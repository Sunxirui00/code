>When trading is mostly confined to between a pair of lines, it is in a channel. The market is always in some kind of channel if you look hard enough to find one, and it usually is simultaneously in several, especially if you look at other time frames. A trend channel is a channel that is diagonal and is contained by a trend line and a trend channel line. For example, a bear channel has a descending trend line above (a bear trend line) and a descending trend channel line below (a bear trend channel line). A trading range is contained between a horizontal support line below and a resistance line above. Sometimes a trading range can be slightly rising or falling, but if so, it is better to think of it as a weak trend channel.
##### 通道与交易区间

当交易主要局限在两条线之间时，这就是一个**通道（channel）**。只要你仔细寻找，市场总是处于某种通道之中，而且通常会同时存在于多个通道中，特别是当你观察其他时间周期时。

---
##### 趋势通道的构成

**趋势通道**是一个对角线通道，由一条趋势线和一条趋势通道线包含。例如，一个看跌通道的上方有一条下降趋势线（看跌趋势线），下方有一条下降趋势通道线（看跌趋势通道线）。

---
##### 交易区间的特性

**交易区间**则被下方水平支撑线和上方水平阻力线所包含。有时交易区间可能会略微上升或下降，但如果是这样，最好将其视为一个弱趋势通道。

>Triangles are also channels, since they are areas of price action contained between two lines.Since they have either higher highs or lower lows, or both in the case of an expanding triangle,they have some trending behavior in addition to their trading range behavior. An expanding triangle is contained between two diverging lines, both of which are technically trend channel lines. The line below is across lower lows, so it is below a bear trend and therefore a trend channel line, and the line above is across higher highs and therefore a bull trend channel line.A contracting triangle is contained between two trend lines, since the market is both in a small bear trend with lower highs and a bull trend with higher lows. An ascending triangle has a resistance line above and a bull trend line below, and a descending triangle has a support line below and a bear trend line above. A wedge is an ascending or descending channel where the trend line and trend channel line converge, and it is a variant of a triangle. An ABC correction in a bull trend is a small bear channel, and when it is in a bear trend it is a small bull channel.
##### 三角形作为通道

三角形也是通道，因为它们是价格行为被两条线包含的区域。由于它们具有更高的高点或更低的低点，或者在扩张三角形的情况下两者兼有，因此除了它们的交易区间行为外，还具有一些趋势行为。

---
##### 各种三角形的特性与组成线

- **扩张三角形：** 被两条发散的线包含，这两条线在技术上都是趋势通道线。
    - 下方的线连接着更低的低点，因此它处于看跌趋势下方，是趋势通道线。
    - 上方的线连接着更高的高点，因此是看涨趋势通道线。
- **收敛三角形：** 被两条趋势线包含，因为市场同时处于具有更低高点的微型看跌趋势和具有更高低点的微型看涨趋势中。
- **上升三角形：** 上方有一条阻力线，下方有一条看涨趋势线。
- **下降三角形：** 下方有一条支撑线，上方有一条看跌趋势线。
- **楔形：** 是一种上升或下降的通道，其中趋势线和趋势通道线收敛，它是三角形的一种变体。
- **ABC 修正：**
    - 在牛市趋势中的 ABC 修正是一个小的看跌通道。    
    - 在熊市趋势中的 ABC 修正是一个小的看涨通道。

>Although the moving average often functions as support or resistance in a strong trend and many traders create curved channels and bands based on the moving average and many other factors, straight trend lines and trend channel lines consistently provide more reliable setups and profitable trades.
##### 移动平均线与趋势线对比

尽管移动平均线在强劲趋势中经常充当支撑或阻力，并且许多交易者会根据移动平均线和许多其他因素创建弯曲通道和波段，但**直线趋势线和趋势通道线始终提供更可靠的交易机会和更有利可图的交易**。

>A bull channel can be in a trading range, a bull trend, a bear trend, or at a possible bottom of a bear trend as the market begins to reverse up. When it is in a trading range, traders can consider buying when in the lower half of the range, but the odds of success become less as the channel progresses into the upper half of the range. When a channel is in a bull trend,higher prices are more certain, and traders should look to buy near the bottom of the channel.The chance of a successful long remains good until the channel begins to have prominent selling pressure, or until it approaches significant resistance. When a channel is especially tight, meaning that the trend line and trend channel lines are close together and the pullbacks are small, it is a sign that the trend is strong, and it can be a spike on a higher time frame chart. A broader channel may follow, which might reach a measured move target, based on the height of the tight channel. A channel that is so tight that it has no pullbacks or only one or two tiny pullbacks is a micro channel, which is discussed in the next chapter.

##### 看涨通道的背景与交易机会
一个看涨通道可能出现在**交易区间**、**看涨趋势**、**看跌趋势**中，或者在市场开始向上反转时，出现在**看跌趋势的可能底部**。

- **在交易区间中：** 交易者可以考虑在区间下半部分买入，但随着通道进入区间的上半部分，成功率会降低。
- **在看涨趋势中：** 价格上涨的可能性更高，交易者应该在通道底部附近寻找买入机会。成功的做多机会会一直存在，直到通道开始出现明显的卖压，或者接近重要的阻力位。

---
##### 紧密通道与宽阔通道
- **紧密通道：** 当通道特别紧密，意味着趋势线和趋势通道线距离很近，并且回调很小，这表明趋势强劲。这在更高时间周期的图表上可能表现为一个急拉（spike）。随后可能会出现一个更宽阔的通道，它可能达到一个基于紧密通道高度的测量目标。
- **微型通道：** 一个紧密到没有回调或只有一两个微小回调的通道是微型通道，这将在下一章中讨论。

>When a bull channel forms in a bear trend, it is a bear flag, and traders should look to short near the top, or on the pullback from a downside breakout. Sometimes when a bear trend begins to reverse up, the first five to 10 bars are in a weak bull channel, with lots of overlapping bars and one or more attempts to break below the bear flag, but these fail and quickly reverse up. After a failed low 2 or low 3, the market then sometimes breaks out to the upside from the bear flag, the market suddenly becomes always-in long, and a bull reversal begins. When traders suspect that a bear flag might be the start of a bull trend, many will buy below the low 1, 2, or 3 signal bars, expecting them to fail and for the market to reverse up.
##### 熊市趋势中的看涨通道：熊旗

当一个看涨通道在熊市趋势中形成时，它是一个**熊旗（bear flag）**。交易者应该考虑在顶部附近做空，或者在向下突破后的回调时做空。

---
##### 熊旗反转成牛市趋势

有时，当熊市趋势开始向上反转时，最初的 5 到 10 根 K 线会形成一个弱看涨通道，其中有许多重叠的 K 线，并伴随着一次或多次尝试跌破熊旗的尝试，但这些尝试都失败了并迅速向上反转。

在一次失败的低点 2 或低点 3 之后，市场有时会从熊旗向上突破，市场突然转变为“永远做多”的状态，牛市反转开始。

---
##### 交易者的预期与行动

当交易者怀疑一个熊旗可能是一个牛市趋势的开始时，许多人会在低点 1、2 或 3 信号 K 线下方买入，预期它们会失败，并且市场会向上反转。

>As a channel is forming, traders are uncertain if there will actually be a channel or just a two-legged move and then a reversal. In fact, you usually cannot even draw channel lines until after the market begins to reverse from the two-legged move and the reversal fails, and the third leg begins. For example, if the market just completed two legs up and has started to reverse, many traders will short the reversal if the rally is not a strong bull trend. However, if the leg down ends and is comparable in size to the first leg down (the leg after the first leg up),and then it reverses up again, traders will now begin to assume that a bull channel is underway rather than a reversal down into a bear leg. Once that second leg ends, traders will draw a trend line from the bottom of the first leg down to the bottom of this second leg and extend it to the right. They will look to buy whenever the market again comes back to the trend line. They will also create a parallel of the line and drag it to the top of the first leg up,and this is their first creation of a channel. Whenever the market rallies up to that trend channel line, traders will take profit on their longs, and look to short. Since a bull channel needs at least those first two legs down to confirm the existence of the channel and the market will usually then test above the top of the second leg up, bull channels usually have at least three pushes up. Traders will usually not look for a reversal and a downside breakout of the channel until after that third leg up forms. However, once it does, especially if there is an overshoot of the trend channel line and a strong bear reversal bar, traders will short aggressively because the odds of a successful downside breakout have increased. Because of this, many bull channels end after a third push up. Likewise, many bear channels end after a third push down.

##### 通道的形成与交易者的不确定性

在通道形成之初，交易者并不确定最终会形成一个通道，还只是一个两波走势，然后反转。实际上，通常直到市场从两波走势开始反转，并且反转失败，第三波走势开始之后，你才能真正画出通道线。

---
##### 识别看涨通道的步骤

例如，如果市场刚刚完成了两波上涨并开始反转，如果这次上涨不是一个强劲的牛市趋势，许多交易者会做空这个反转。然而，如果下跌波段结束，并且其大小与第一波下跌（第一波上涨之后的下跌）相当，然后再次向上反转，交易者就会开始认为一个看涨通道正在形成，而不是反转进入一个看跌波段。

一旦第二波结束，交易者就会从第一波下跌的底部到第二波下跌的底部绘制一条趋势线，并将其向右延伸。每当市场再次回到这条趋势线时，他们就会寻找买入机会。他们还会创建这条线的平行线，并将其拖动到第一波上涨的顶部，这是他们第一次创建通道。

---
##### 通道内的交易与反转预期

每当市场反弹到趋势通道线时，交易者就会对他们的多头头寸获利了结，并寻找做空机会。

由于看涨通道至少需要最初的两次下跌才能确认通道的存在，并且市场通常会随后测试第二次上涨的顶部上方，所以看涨通道通常至少有**三次向上推升**。

交易者通常不会寻找反转和通道的向下突破，直到第三次上涨形成之后。然而，一旦第三次上涨形成，特别是如果出现趋势通道线的超调和强劲的看跌反转 K 线，交易者就会积极做空，因为成功向下突破的可能性已经增加。因此，许多看涨通道在第三次向上推升后结束。同样，许多看跌通道在第三次向下推升后结束。

>Why does the market race toward the top and bottom of the channel? This is because of a vacuum effect. For example, if there is a bull channel and there is a leg that is approaching the trend channel line above, the traders believe that the market will likely touch that line and may even go a tick or two above it. Since they believe that the market will go at least a little higher than it is right now, they will hold back on their selling. The bulls want to sell out of their longs eventually to take profits, and the bears want to sell to initiate new shorts. The current relative absence of selling creates a buy imbalance, and whenever there is any imbalance, the market moves quickly. The result is that there is often a large bull trend bar or two that form as the market tests the top of the channel. This often attracts overly eager bulls to buy at the top of the spike since they think the market is forming a new, stronger bull leg.However, most breakout attempts fail, and this one will likely fail as well. Why? Because of the institutional traders. The strong bears want to short, but they believe that the market will touch that upper trend channel line, so they wait. Once the market is there, they short heavily and overwhelm the bulls. They like to see a strong bull trend bar because they believe that the market will go lower and there is no better price to short than at the point of maximum bullishness. The market might pause for a small bar at the top of the bull trend bar as both the bulls and the bears decide if the breakout will fail, but it will usually then quickly fall since both the institutional bulls and bears know that the odds are strongly in favor of all breakout attempts failing.
##### 市场冲向通道顶部和底部的“真空效应”

市场之所以会冲向通道的顶部和底部，是因为存在一种**真空效应**。

---
##### 真空效应的形成（以看涨通道为例）

例如，如果有一个看涨通道，并且价格正在接近上方的趋势通道线，交易者们会相信市场很可能会触及那条线，甚至可能超出一两个跳动点。由于他们相信市场至少会比现在高一点，他们会**暂时按兵不动，推迟卖出**。多头最终想卖出获利了结，而空头想卖出开立新空头头寸。当前相对缺乏卖盘，造成了**买盘失衡**，而任何失衡都会导致市场快速移动。

结果是，当市场测试通道顶部时，通常会形成一到两根大型看涨趋势 K 线。这常常吸引过于心急的多头在急拉的顶部买入，因为他们认为市场正在形成新的、更强的看涨腿。

---
##### 机构交易者的作用与突破失败的原因

然而，**大多数突破尝试都会失败**，这次也很可能会失败。为什么？因为**机构交易者**。

强大的空头想要做空，但他们相信市场会触及上方的趋势通道线，所以他们等待。一旦市场到达那里，他们就会大量做空，压倒多头。他们喜欢看到强劲的看涨趋势 K 线，因为他们相信市场会走低，没有比在**看涨情绪最浓时**更好的做空价格了。

市场可能会在看涨趋势 K 线顶部暂停一小根 K 线，因为多头和空头都在决定突破是否会失败，但随后通常会迅速下跌，因为机构的多头和空头都知道，**所有突破尝试都倾向于失败的可能性极高**。

>So what do those strong institutional bulls do? They stop buying and they quickly sell out of their longs, capturing a brief windfall profit. They know that this opportunity will likely be brief because the market does not stay at an extreme for long, so they exit and they won't look to buy again for at least a bar or two. The relative absence of these institutional bulls and the aggressiveness of the institutional bears force the market down quickly to the bottom of the channel, where the opposite process begins. Both the bulls and the bears expect the trend line below to be tested; the bears will keep shorting until the market gets there and then they will buy back their shorts as they take their profits, and the bulls won't buy until the market gets there. This creates a brief, sharp move down that will entice beginning traders into shorting, expecting a bear breakout, but they are doing the exact opposite of the institutions.Remember, your job is to follow what the institutions are doing. You should not be doing what you hope they will soon do, and you should never do the exact opposite of what they are doing. Each of these small pullbacks is a micro sell vacuum. Once the market gets close to the bottom of the channel, both the bulls and the bears expect the market to reach the bull trend line and they stop buying until it gets there. Once there, the bulls buy to initiate new longs and the bears take profits on their short scalps. Both expect a new channel high and a test of the top of the channel, where the process begins again. This takes place in all channels, including in trading ranges and triangles.
##### 机构多头的行为

那么，那些强大的机构多头会怎么做呢？他们会停止买入，并迅速卖出他们的多头头寸，以获取短暂的意外之财。他们知道这个机会可能转瞬即逝，因为市场不会长时间停留在极端点，所以他们退出，并且至少在一两根 K 线内不会再寻找买入机会。

---
##### 市场底部的过程

这些机构多头的相对缺席以及机构空头的积极性，迫使市场迅速跌至通道底部，这时相反的过程就开始了。

多头和空头都预计下方的趋势线将被测试；空头会持续做空直到市场到达那里，然后他们会平仓获利，而多头在市场到达那里之前不会买入。这会造成一个短暂而急剧的下跌，诱使初学者交易者做空，期望出现熊市突破，但他们正在做的事情与机构恰恰相反。

记住，你的工作是**跟随机构的行为**。你不应该做你希望他们很快会做的事情，你绝不应该做与他们正在做的事情完全相反的事情。

---
##### 微型卖盘真空与通道内的循环

每一次小幅回调都是一个**微型卖盘真空**。一旦市场接近通道底部，多头和空头都预计市场会触及牛市趋势线，他们会停止买入直到市场到达那里。一旦到达，多头会买入开立新多头头寸，而空头会对他们的短线空头获利了结。双方都期望出现新的通道高点并测试通道顶部，然后这个过程再次开始。

这在所有通道中都会发生，包括在交易区间和三角形中。

>Even in a trend channel, there is two-sided trading taking place and this is trading range behavior. In fact, a trend channel can be thought of as a sloping trading range. When the slope is steep and the channel is tight, it behaves more like a trend, and trades should be taken only in the direction of the trend. When the slope is less steep and there are broad swings within the channel, some lasting five or even 10 bars, the market is behaving more like a trading range and can be traded in both directions. As with all trading ranges, there is a magnetic pull in the middle of the trading range that tends to keep the market in the range. Why does the market stay in a channel and not suddenly accelerate? Because there is too much uncertainty,like with all trading ranges.
##### 趋势通道的双向交易行为
即使在趋势通道中，也存在双向交易，这体现了交易区间的行为。事实上，可以将趋势通道视为一个**倾斜的交易区间**。

---
##### 趋势通道的交易策略
- **斜率陡峭且通道紧密时：** 市场行为更像一个趋势，交易应该只沿着趋势方向进行。
- **斜率较不陡峭且通道内有大幅摆动（有些甚至持续五到十根 K 线）时：** 市场行为更像一个交易区间，可以双向交易。

---
##### 市场保持通道内的原因
与所有交易区间一样，交易区间中部存在一种磁性吸引力，倾向于将市场保持在区间内。
为什么市场会停留在通道内而不会突然加速呢？因为存在太多的不确定性，这和所有交易区间的情况一样。

>For example, in a bull channel, the bulls want to buy more, but at a lower price. The weak shorts want a sell-off so they can exit with a smaller loss. Both the bulls and the weak bears are concerned that there may not be a pullback that will allow them to buy all of the shares that they want to buy (the weak shorts are buying back their losing short positions) at a better price, so they continue to buy in pieces as the market goes up, and this adds to the buying pressure. They buy even more aggressively on any small dip, like with a limit order below the low of the prior bar or at the moving average or near the trend line that forms the bottom of the channel.
##### 牛市通道中的买卖双方心理

举例来说，在一个看涨通道中，多头希望以更低的价格买入更多。而弱势空头则希望出现抛售，以便能够以更小的损失离场。

---
##### 市场上涨的推动力

多头和弱势空头都担心可能不会出现回调，无法让他们以更好的价格买到所有他们想要买入的股票（弱势空头正在回补他们亏损的空头头寸），所以他们会在市场上涨时**继续分批买入**，这增加了买盘压力。他们在任何小幅下跌时会更加积极地买入，例如在前一根 K 线低点下方、移动平均线处或通道底部趋势线附近设置限价订单。

>In general, when a channel is beginning it is better to trade with the trend, and as it is approaching a target area and as it develops more two-sided trading, experienced traders will often to start trading countertrend. So at the start of a bull channel, it is better to buy below the lows of bars, but as the channel reaches resistance areas and starts to have more overlapping bars, bear bars, deeper pullbacks, and prominent tails, it is better to consider shorting above bars instead of buying below bars.

##### 通道不同阶段的交易策略

一般来说，当一个通道**刚开始形成时，最好顺应趋势进行交易**。

---

##### 临近目标区域与双向交易

随着通道接近目标区域，并且发展出更多的双向交易，经验丰富的交易者通常会开始**逆势交易**。

因此，在看涨通道的开始阶段，最好在 K 线低点下方买入。但随着通道达到阻力区域，并开始出现更多重叠的 K 线、看跌 K 线、更深的回调以及显著的影线时，最好考虑在 K 线上方做空，而不是在 K 线下方买入。

>However, for traders just starting out, whenever they see a channel, they should trade only with the trend, if at all. Trading channels is very difficult because they are always trying to reverse, and have many pullbacks. This is confusing to beginning traders and they often take repeated losses. If there is a bull channel, they should only look to buy. The most reliable buy signal will be a high 2 with a bull signal bar at the moving average where the entry is not too close to the top of the channel. This kind of perfect setup does not occur often. If traders are just starting out, they should wait for the very best setups, even if that means missing the entire trend. More experienced traders can buy on limit orders below weak sell signals and near the moving average and near the bottom of the channel. If traders are not consistently profitable, they should avoid taking any sell signals in a bull channel, even if there is a small lower high. The market is always-in long and they should not be looking to short, even though there will be many signals that look acceptable. Wait for the market to become clearly always-in short before looking to short. That will usually require a strong bear spike that breaks below the channel and below the moving average and has follow-through, and then has a lower high with a bear signal bar. If the setup is any weaker than that, beginners should wait and only look to buy pullbacks. Do not fall into the regression toward the mean mind-set and assume that the channel looks so weak that a reversal is long overdue. The market can continue its unsustainable behavior much longer than you can sustain your account as you bet against that very weak-looking trend.

##### 初学者在通道中的交易策略

对于刚开始交易的交易者来说，无论何时看到通道，如果决定交易，都应该**只顺应趋势进行**。交易通道非常困难，因为它们总是在尝试反转，并且有许多回调，这会令初学者感到困惑，常常导致他们反复亏损。

- **看涨通道：** 如果是看涨通道，初学者应该只考虑买入。最可靠的买入信号是出现一个带有看涨信号 K 线的**高点 2（high 2）**，发生在移动平均线附近，且入场点离通道顶部不太近。这种完美的交易机会并不常见。如果交易者刚开始，他们应该等待最好的交易机会，即使这意味着错过整个趋势。
    
- **有经验的交易者：** 更有经验的交易者可以在较弱的卖出信号下方、移动平均线附近以及通道底部附近使用限价订单买入。
    

---

##### 避免逆势交易的诱惑

如果交易者尚未持续盈利，他们应**避免在看涨通道中接受任何卖出信号**，即使出现小幅更低的高点。市场总是处于“永远做多”的状态，他们不应该寻找做空机会，即使会有许多看起来可以接受的信号。

---

##### 等待明确的趋势反转

请等待市场明确转变为**“永远做空”**状态后再寻找做空机会。这通常需要出现：

- 一个**强劲的看跌急拉**，跌破通道和移动平均线。
    
- 随后有**延续性**。
    
- 然后出现一个**更低的高点**，并伴有看跌信号 K 线。
    

如果交易机会比这弱，初学者就应该等待，只寻找买入回调的机会。

---

##### 避免“回归均值”思维陷阱

不要陷入“回归均值”的心态，并假设通道看起来如此疲软，以至于反转早已该发生。市场可以比你账户所能承受的时间更长久地维持其不可持续的行为，如果你一直押注这种看起来非常疲弱的趋势，很可能会亏损。

>Many bulls will be scaling into their long positions as the market goes up, and they will be using every conceivable logical approach to do this. Some will buy on a pullback to the moving average, or below the low of the prior bar, or on pullbacks at fixed intervals, like every 50 cents below the most recent high in AAPL. Others will buy as the market appears to be resuming the channel up, like every 25 cents above the prior low. If you can think of an approach, so can some programmer, and if she can show that it is effective mathematically,her firm will probably try trading it.

##### 看涨交易者如何建仓

许多看涨交易者会在市场上涨过程中**分批建仓**，他们会运用各种可以想象到的逻辑方法。

- 有些人会在**回调到移动平均线**时买入。
    
- 或者在**前一根 K 线的低点下方**买入。
    
- 又或者在**固定间隔的回调**时买入，比如苹果（AAPL）股价每下跌 50 美分就买入。
    

还有一些人会在市场似乎正在恢复通道上涨时买入，比如在之前低点上方每上涨 25 美分就买入。

---

只要你能想到一种方法，就肯定有程序员能想到，而且如果她能通过数学证明其有效性，她的公司很可能会尝试用这种方法进行交易。

>With both the bulls and trapped bears wanting lower prices but afraid that they will not come,both continue to buy until they have nothing left to buy. This always happens at some magnet like a measured move or a higher time frame trend line or trend channel line. Since channels usually go much further than what most traders expect, the trend usually continues up beyond the first one or more obvious resistance levels until it reaches one where enough strong bulls and bears agree that the market has gone far enough and will likely not go much higher. At that point, the market runs out of buying pressure and the strong bulls take profits and sell out of their longs, and the strong bears come in and sell more aggressively. This results in a reversal into a deeper correction or into an opposite trend. The bull trend often ends with a breakout of the top of the channel as the last desperate bears buy back their shorts in despair, and the weakest bulls who have been waiting and waiting for lower prices finally just buy at the market. The strong bears expect that and will often wait for the strong breakout and then begin shorting relentlessly. They believe that this is a brief opportunity to short at a very high price and that the market won't stay here for long. The strong bulls see the spike up as a gift and they exit their longs and will now buy again only after at least a two-legged pullback lasting at least 10 bars. They often will not buy until the market gets down to the beginning of the channel, where they originally bought into a profitable trade. The strong bears know this and will look to take profits exactly where the strong bulls will be buying again; the result usually is a bounce and then often a trading range as both sides become uncertain about the direction of the next move. Uncertainty usually means that the market is in a trading range.

##### 多空双方的“害怕错过”与吸磁效应

多头和被套的空头都希望价格走低，但又担心价格不会如愿，于是双方都继续买入，直到再无可买。这种情况总是发生在某个**吸磁点**，比如一个等幅测量目标，或者更高时间周期的趋势线或趋势通道线。

---

##### 趋势的延续与反转

由于通道通常会超出大多数交易者的预期，所以趋势通常会继续上涨，越过第一个或多个明显的阻力位，直到达到一个足够多的强势多头和空头都认为市场已经走得足够远，不太可能再大幅上涨的位置。在那个点上，市场耗尽了买盘压力，强势多头获利了结并卖出他们的多头头寸，强势空头介入并更积极地卖出。这导致市场反转，进入更深的回调或相反的趋势。

---

##### 牛市趋势的终结与空头的策略

牛市趋势通常以**突破通道顶部**而告终，因为绝望的空头最终绝望地回补他们的空头头寸，而那些一直等待更低价格的最弱势多头也终于以市价买入。强势空头预料到这种情况，并常常会等待强势突破发生，然后开始不懈地做空。他们相信这是一个以非常高的价格做空的短暂机会，市场不会在这里停留太久。

---

##### 强势多头的应对与市场不确定性

强势多头将这种急拉视为一个礼物，他们会退出多头头寸，并且至少在持续至少 10 根 K 线的两波回调之后才会再次买入。他们通常会等到市场跌回通道的起点，也就是他们最初买入获利交易的地方才会买入。强势空头知道这一点，并会精确地在强势多头将再次买入的地方获利了结；结果通常是**一次反弹，然后常常是一个交易区间**，因为双方都对下一步的走向感到不确定。不确定性通常意味着市场处于交易区间中。

>Or at least that is the conventional logic, but it is probably more complicated, sophisticated,and unknowable. All institutions are familiar with this pattern, and you can be certain that their programmers are constantly looking for ways to capitalize on it. One thing an institution might do is try to create a buy climax. If it has been buying all the way up and is ready to take profits but it wants to be sure that the top is in, it could suddenly buy a final big piece with the realization that it might even take a small loss on it, but with the goal of creating a climactic reversal on the charts. If the firm is successful, and it might be if several other institutions are running programs that are doing similar things, it can exit all of its longs, most with a profit,and then even reverse to short, confident that the sellers now control the market.

##### 市场行为的复杂性与机构操纵

或者至少这是传统的逻辑，但它可能更加复杂、精妙且不可知。所有机构都熟悉这种模式，你可以确信他们的程序员正在不断寻找从中获利的方法。

---

##### 机构如何制造买盘高潮

机构可能会做的一件事是尝试制造一个**买盘高潮（buy climax）**。如果它一路买入并且准备获利了结，但又想确保顶部已经形成，它可能会突然买入最后一大笔，即使意识到这可能会带来小额损失，但目标是在图表上制造一个高潮式反转。如果这家公司成功了（如果其他几家机构也在运行类似的程序，它就有可能成功），它就可以退出所有多头头寸，大部分带有利润，甚至反手做空，确信卖方现在控制了市场。

>Does this happen with every climax? It is unknowable and irrelevant. Your goal is to follow what the institutions are doing, and you can see it on the charts. You never have to know anything about the programs behind the patterns, and the institutions themselves never know what types of programs the other institutions are running. They only know their own programs, but the market rarely goes far unless many institutions are trading in the same direction at the same time, and they have to be trading with enough size to overwhelm the other institutions that are doing the opposite. The only time that the vast majority of the institutions are on the same side is during the spike phase of a strong trend, and that occurs in fewer than 5 percent of the bars on the chart.

##### 并非所有高潮都由人为制造

你问：“这会发生在每一个高潮吗？”这是**不可知且无关紧要**的。你的目标是跟随机构正在做的事情，你可以在图表上看到这一切。

---

##### 把握价格行为的本质

你永远不需要了解模式背后的程序，机构本身也从不知道其他机构在运行什么类型的程序。他们只知道自己的程序，但市场很少会走得很远，除非许多机构同时朝着相同的方向交易，而且它们的交易量必须足够大，才能压倒那些做相反事情的机构。

绝大多数机构站在同一边的唯一时间是在**强劲趋势的急拉阶段**，这在图表上出现的 K 线不到 5%。

>It is not just bulls and weak shorts who are placing trades as the channel continues up. Strong shorts are also selling as the market moves higher, scaling into their positions, believing that the upside is limited and ultimately their trade will be profitable. Their selling begins to create selling pressure in the form of more bars with bear bodies, larger bear bodies, tails on the tops of the bars, and more bars with lows below the low of the prior bar. They are looking for a downside breakout of the channel and maybe even a test to the beginning of the channel.Since they want to short at the best possible price, they are selling as the market is going up rather than waiting for the reversal. This is because the reversal might be fast and strong and then they would end up shorting much further below the top of the channel than they believe is likely to be profitable.

##### 通道上涨中的交易者群体

在通道持续上涨的过程中，不仅仅是多头和弱势空头在进行交易，**强势空头**也在市场走高时卖出，分批建立他们的头寸，他们相信上涨空间有限，最终他们的交易会获利。

---

##### 强势空头施加的卖压

他们的卖出开始形成卖压，表现为：

- 更多带有看跌实体的 K 线。
    
- 更大的看跌实体。
    
- K 线顶部的影线。
    
- 更多 K 线低点低于前一根 K 线低点。
    

他们正在寻找通道的向下突破，甚至可能测试通道的起点。

---

##### 强势空头选择在上涨中做空的原因

由于他们希望以尽可能最好的价格做空，他们会在市场上涨时卖出，而不是等待反转。这是因为反转可能又快又强，那么他们最终做空的价格将远低于他们认为可能获利通道顶部。

>They have several ways to add to their short position, like selling on a limit order above the high of the prior bar or above a minor swing high in the channel, at every test of the top of the channel at the trend channel line, at measured move targets, at a fixed interval as the market goes up (like every 50 cents higher in AAPL), or on each potential top. Once the market reverses, they might hold their entire position with the expectation of a significant reversal, or they might exit at a profit target, like on a test of the trend line at the bottom of the channel or even at the entry price of their first short, which is often near the start of the channel. If they do that, their first entry will be a breakeven trade and they will have a profit on their higher entries.

##### 增加空头头寸的方式

强势空头有几种方式来增加他们的空头头寸：

- **限价订单：** 在前一根 K 线的高点上方，或通道内的一个小型摆动高点上方，设置限价订单卖出。
    
- **趋势通道线测试：** 在每次市场测试通道顶部趋势通道线时卖出。
    
- **测量目标位：** 在达到测量目标位时卖出。
    
- **固定间隔：** 随着市场上涨，以固定的价格间隔（例如，苹果（AAPL）每上涨 50 美分）卖出。
    
- **潜在顶部：** 在每个潜在的顶部卖出。
    

---

##### 反转后的平仓策略

一旦市场反转，他们可能会持有全部头寸，预期会出现大幅反转；或者他们可能会在达到利润目标时平仓，例如在测试通道底部趋势线时，甚至在他们第一次做空的入场价格（通常接近通道的起点）平仓。如果他们这样做，他们的第一次入场将是盈亏平衡交易，而更高点位的入场将带来利润。

>If you are scaling into shorts in that bull channel, it is best to do this only in the first two-thirds of the day. You do not want to find yourself heavily short in a bull channel with your breakeven entry so far below that you don't have enough time left to get out without a loss, never mind with a large profit. In general, if you are trading a channel in the second half of the day, it is far better to only trade with the trend, like buying below the low of the prior bar, or above every bull reversal bar at the moving average.

在看涨通道中，如果你正在**分批做空**，最好只在**当天交易日的前三分之二**进行。

---

##### 日内交易策略与风险管理

你不会希望自己在看涨通道中持有大量空头头寸，且盈亏平衡点离得太远，以至于没有足够的时间在不亏损的情况下平仓，更不用说获得巨额利润了。

总的来说，如果你在**交易日的后半段**交易一个通道，最好**只顺应趋势交易**，比如在前一根 K 线的低点下方买入，或者在移动平均线处的每根看涨反转 K 线上方买入。

>If the market continues higher than the shorts believe is likely, they will buy back their entire position at a loss, and this is probably a significant contributor to the climactic upside breakout that sometimes comes at the end of a channel. They no longer expect a pullback any time soon that would allow them to buy at a better price, and instead buy at the market and take losses on all of their short entries. Since many are momentum traders, many will switch to long. All the momentum-trading bulls will aggressively buy as the market accelerates upward because they know that the math is on their side. The directional probability of the next tick being higher and not lower is more than 50 percent, so they have an edge. Even though the breakout might be brief and the reversal sharp, their buy programs will continue to buy as long as the logic supports doing so. However, this is like musical chairs; as soon as the momentum music stops, everyone quickly grabs a chair, which means that they exit their longs very quickly. As they are selling out of their longs, there are aggressive bears shorting as well and this can create a strong imbalance in favor of the bears. If the bears take control, the sell-off will usually last at least 10 bars and there will usually be a reversal back below the trend channel line and into the channel, and then a breakout of the downside of the channel.

当市场持续上涨，超出空头预期的可能性时，他们会**亏损回补全部头寸**。这可能是导致通道末端有时出现的**高潮式上涨突破**的重要原因。他们不再期望短期内会出现回调，从而以更好的价格买入，而是选择市价买入并承担所有空头入场点的损失。

---

##### 动量交易者的行为与突破后的反转

由于许多是**动量交易者**，他们会转向做多。所有动量交易的多头会积极买入，因为他们知道数学优势在他们这边——下一个跳动点上涨而非下跌的方向概率超过 50%，所以他们有优势。

尽管突破可能短暂，反转可能剧烈，但他们的买入程序会持续买入，只要逻辑支持这样做。然而，这就像**抢椅子游戏**；一旦动量之声停止，每个人都会迅速抢一个椅子，这意味着他们会非常迅速地平仓。当他们卖出多头头寸时，积极的空头也在做空，这可能会造成有利于空头的强烈失衡。如果空头掌控局面，抛售通常会持续至少 10 根 K 线，并且通常会出现反转，跌回趋势通道线下方并进入通道，然后向下突破通道。

>The television pundits will attribute the sharp upside breakout to some news item, and there are always many to choose from, because they see the market only from the perspective of a traditional stock trader who trades on fundamentals. They don't understand that many things that happen, especially over the course of an hour or so, have nothing to do with fundamentals and are instead the result of large programs doing the same thing at once with no regard for the fundamentals. Once the market quickly reverses on the climactic blow-off,they move on to the next story. They never address the fact that they just gave a report that was foolishly naive, and they remain completely oblivious to the powerful technical forces that drive the market in the short run. Every few years there is an exceptionally huge intraday move, and that is pretty much the only time that they will acknowledge that technical factors were at work. In fact, they invariably blame it on programs, as if the programs suddenly briefly appeared. There is nothing to blame. The vast majority of all intraday price movement is due to programs, yet the reporters don't have a clue. All they see are earnings reports, quarterly sales, and profit margins.

##### 电视评论员的盲点

电视评论员会将剧烈的上涨突破归因于某个新闻事件，而且总是有很多选择，因为他们只从传统股票交易者（根据基本面进行交易）的角度看待市场。

他们不明白，许多事情的发生，尤其是在一个小时左右的时间里，与基本面毫无关系，而是**大型程序同时进行相同操作的结果，完全不考虑基本面**。一旦市场在高潮式抛售中迅速反转，他们就会转向下一个故事。

---

##### 对技术力量的忽视

他们从不承认他们刚刚发布的报告是极其幼稚的，并且对短期内驱动市场的强大技术力量完全一无所知。每隔几年就会出现一次异常巨大的盘中波动，而这几乎是他们唯一会承认技术因素在起作用的时候。事实上，他们总是将此归咎于程序，就好像这些程序是突然短暂出现的一样。

---

没有什么好指责的。**绝大多数的盘中价格波动都是由程序造成的**，然而记者们却一无所知。他们只看到收益报告、季度销售额和利润率。

>Since a channel is a sloping trading range, just like with other trading ranges, most attempts to break out of either the top or the bottom fail. Yes, one side is stronger, but the principle is the same as for any trading range. For example, in a bull channel, both bulls and bears are active but the bulls are stronger and that is why the channel is sloping up. Both the bulls and the bears are comfortable placing trades in the middle of the channel, but when the market gets near the top of the channel, the bulls become concerned that the upside breakout will fail;and as soon as they think that a failure is likely, they will sell out of some of their longs. Also,the bears were comfortable shorting in the middle of the channel and will short even more aggressively near the top, at a better value. When the market gets near the bottom of the range, the bears are less interested in shorting at these lower prices and the bulls, who were just buying moments ago at higher prices, will buy even more aggressively here. This leads to a bounce up off of the trend line. The market usually pokes below the channel one or more times as it is forming, and you have to redraw the trend line. The result is usually a slightly broader and flatter channel. Ultimately, the downside breakout will be strong enough to be followed by a lower high and then a lower low, and when that happens, traders will begin to draw a bear channel, even if the bull channel still exists, albeit much wider.

##### 通道：倾斜的交易区间

由于通道是一个倾斜的交易区间，就像其他交易区间一样，**大多数尝试突破顶部或底部的尝试都会失败**。是的，某一方更强，但其原理与任何交易区间相同。

---

##### 看涨通道中的多空博弈

例如，在一个看涨通道中，多头和空头都很活跃，但多头更强，这就是通道向上倾斜的原因。

- **通道中部：** 多头和空头都乐于在通道中部进行交易。
    
- **接近通道顶部：** 当市场接近通道顶部时，多头开始担心向上突破会失败；一旦他们认为失败可能发生，就会卖出部分多头头寸。同时，空头在通道中部做空时感到舒适，在顶部附近更好的价值区域会更积极地做空。
    
- **接近通道底部：** 当市场接近通道底部时，空头对在这些较低价格做空兴趣减弱，而刚刚还在更高价格买入的多头，会在这里更积极地买入。这导致价格从趋势线上方反弹。
    

---

##### 趋势线重绘与通道演变

市场在形成过程中通常会一或多次跌破通道，你不得不重绘趋势线。结果通常是一个稍微更宽、更平的通道。

---

##### 下跌突破与熊市通道的形成

最终，向下突破将足够强劲，随后将形成一个更低的高点，然后是更低的低点。当这种情况发生时，交易者将开始绘制一个看跌通道，即使原来的看涨通道仍然存在，尽管它会变得更宽。

>It is important to realize that most bull breakouts of bull channels fail. If the bulls are able to create a bull breakout and they can overwhelm the bears, they usually will be able to do so for only a few bars. At that point, the bulls will see the market as too overdone and will take profits; they won't want to buy until the market has corrected for a while. The magnetic effect of the middle of the channel will usually pull the market back into the channel and cause the breakout to fail, making the breakout a buy climax. Once back in the channel, the market usually pokes through the bottom of the channel as its minimum objective. The buy climax usually leads to a two-legged correction that lasts about 10 bars and usually breaks below the channel. Once the downside breakout happens, if the selling continues the next objective is a measured move equal to about the height of the channel. The bears also know that the buy climax will likely be followed by a correction and they will short aggressively. With the bulls selling out of their longs, there is strong selling pressure and the market corrects down and can even become a bear trend.

##### 看涨通道向上突破的常见失败模式

理解这一点很重要：**大多数看涨通道的向上突破都会失败**。

如果多头能够成功制造一个向上突破并压倒空头，这种优势通常只能维持几根 K 线。到那时，多头会认为市场已经“超买”，并会获利了结；他们不会想再买入，直到市场回调一段时间。

通道中部的**磁性效应**通常会将市场拉回通道内，导致突破失败，使这次突破成为一个**买盘高潮（buy climax）**。一旦回到通道内，市场通常会跌破通道底部，这是它的最小目标。

---

##### 买盘高潮后的市场走势

买盘高潮通常会导致一个持续约 10 根 K 线的两波修正，并且通常会跌破通道。一旦向下突破发生，如果卖压持续，下一个目标是**一个等于通道高度的等幅测量移动**。

空头也知道买盘高潮之后很可能会出现修正，他们会积极做空。随着多头卖出他们的多头头寸，市场出现强大的卖压，价格会向下修正，甚至可能转变为一个看跌趋势。

>Sometimes an upside breakout of a bull channel is strong and does not fail within a few bars.When this is the case, the market will usually rally to a measured move target, and the breakout will become a measuring gap. For example, if the bull channel has a wedge shape,and breaks to the downside, but the downside breakout fails within a few bars, and then the market races up and breaks above the top of the wedge, the rally will usually reach a measured move up that is equal to about the height of the wedge. The trend bar or bars that break above the wedge then become a measuring gap. Gaps, measured moves, and breakouts are discussed in book 2.

##### 看涨通道向上突破的例外情况

有时，看涨通道的向上突破非常强劲，并且在几根 K 线内没有失败。当出现这种情况时，市场通常会反弹到一个**等幅测量目标（measured move target）**，而这次突破将成为一个**测量缺口（measuring gap）**。

---

##### 楔形突破的案例

例如，如果看涨通道呈楔形，并向下突破，但向下突破在几根 K 线内失败，然后市场迅速上涨并突破楔形顶部，那么这次反弹通常会达到一个等于楔形高度的等幅测量上涨。随后，突破楔形的趋势 K 线或 K 线组将成为一个测量缺口。

---

##### 相关概念的延伸阅读

缺口、等幅测量移动和突破将在第二本书中进行讨论。

>If instead of an upside breakout, there is a downside breakout but without a failed upside breakout, buy climax, and bear reversal, the market usually goes sideways for a number of bars. It may form a lower high and then a second leg down, or the trading range might become a bull flag and lead to a resumption of the bull trend. Less commonly, there is a strong spike down and a strong bear reversal. The opposite of all of this is true for bear channels.Since a trend channel is simply a sloping trading range, it usually functions like a flag. If there is a bull channel, no matter how steep or protracted, it usually will have a downside breakout at some point and therefore can be thought of as a bear flag even if there was no bear trend preceding it. At some point, the strong bulls will take profits and they will be willing to buy again only after a significant pull-back. That pullback often has to go all the way to the beginning of the channel, where they began buying earlier, and this is part of the reason why channels often lead to a correction all the way to the bottom of the channel, where there is usually a bounce. The strong bears are as smart as the strong bulls, and generally just when the strong bulls stop buying, the strong bears begin to aggressively short and will not be shaken out higher. In fact, they will see higher prices as an even better value and they will short more. Where will they take profits on their shorts? Near the bottom of the channel, just where the strong bulls might try to reestablish their longs.

##### 看涨通道向下突破的不同情景

如果不是向上突破，而是出现向下突破，但没有失败的向上突破、买盘高潮和看跌反转，市场通常会**横向整理一段时间**。它可能形成一个更低的高点，然后是第二波下跌，或者交易区间可能成为一个看涨旗形，并导致牛市趋势的恢复。

较不常见的是，会出现一个强劲的向下急拉和强劲的看跌反转。所有这些的相反情况对于看跌通道来说也是成立的。

---

##### 趋势通道作为旗形

由于趋势通道只是一个倾斜的交易区间，它通常会像一个**旗形**一样运作。如果有一个看涨通道，无论它有多么陡峭或持久，它通常都会在某个时候出现向下突破，因此即使之前没有看跌趋势，它也可以被视为一个**看跌旗形**。

---

##### 多空力量的博弈

在某个时候，强势多头会获利了结，只有在大幅回调之后，他们才愿意再次买入。这种回调通常必须一直回到通道的起点，也就是他们之前开始买入的地方，这也是通道经常导致价格一直修正到通道底部的原因之一，那里通常会出现反弹。

强势空头和强势多头一样聪明，通常就在强势多头停止买入的时候，强势空头开始积极做空，并且不会被更高的价格吓跑。事实上，他们会把更高的价格视为更好的价值，并会做空更多。

他们会在哪里对他们的空头头寸获利了结呢？在**通道底部附近**，就在强势多头可能尝试重新建立多头头寸的地方。

>Because a bull channel behaves like a bear flag, it should be traded like a bear flag. Similarly,any bear channel should be viewed as a bull flag. There may or may not be a bull trend that precedes it, but that is irrelevant. Sometimes there will be a higher time frame bull trend that might not be evident on the 5 minute chart, and when that happens, the bear channel will appear as a bull flag on that chart. Although a higher time frame trend might increase the chances of a bull breakout and the chances that the breakout will be strong and go further,you will so often see huge bull breakouts from bear channels that it is not necessary to look for a higher time frame bull trend to trade the channel like a bull flag. The opposite is true of bull channels, which are functionally bear flags.

##### 通道的旗形行为与交易策略

因为一个看涨通道表现得像一个看跌旗形，所以它应该像一个看跌旗形那样进行交易。同样，任何看跌通道都应该被视为一个看涨旗形。

---

##### 高时间周期趋势的影响

通道之前可能存在或不存在看涨趋势，但这无关紧要。有时会有更高时间周期的看涨趋势，这在 5 分钟图上可能不明显，当这种情况发生时，看跌通道在该图表上将显示为看涨旗形。

虽然更高时间周期的趋势可能会增加看涨突破的机会，以及突破会强劲并走得更远的可能性，但你经常会看到看跌通道出现巨大的看涨突破，因此没有必要寻找更高时间周期的看涨趋势来像交易看涨旗形一样交易该通道。

对于看涨通道（功能上是看跌旗形）而言，情况则相反。

>Since a bull channel is a bear flag, there is usually a bear breakout eventually. Sometimes,however, there is a bull breakout above the channel. In most cases, this breakout is climactic and unsustainable. It might last for just a bar or two, but sometimes it lasts for five or more bars before the market reverses down. Less often, the bull trend will continue in a very strong trend. If it reverses, it usually reenters the channel, and with any channel breakout that reenters the channel, it usually tests the opposite side of the channel. After a failed breakout of the top of a bull channel, since this is a type of climax, the reversal should have at least two legs down and last at least 10 bars, and it often becomes a trend reversal. The opposite is true of a downside breakout of a bear channel. It usually is a sell climax and reverses back above the channel and has at least two legs up.

##### 看涨通道作为看跌旗形的最终突破

既然看涨通道是看跌旗形，那么最终通常会出现**看跌突破**。然而，有时也会出现**向上突破通道**的情况。

在大多数情况下，这种向上突破是**高潮性的，不可持续的**。它可能只持续一两根 K 线，但有时会持续五根或更多 K 线，然后市场向下反转。较少见的是，牛市趋势会以非常强劲的趋势继续。

---

##### 失败突破后的反转与修正

如果市场反转，它通常会**重新进入通道**。任何重新进入通道的通道突破，通常都会测试通道的另一侧。

在看涨通道顶部失败的突破之后，由于这是一种高潮形态，反转应该至少有**两波下跌**并持续至少 **10 根 K 线**，而且通常会成为**趋势反转**。

对于看跌通道的向下突破而言，情况则相反。它通常是一个**卖盘高潮**，并反转回到通道上方，并至少有**两波上涨**。

>All channels eventually end in a breakout, which can be violent or have very little momentum.Trend channels usually last much longer than what most traders suspect and they often trap traders into prematurely taking reversal trades. Most channels usually have at least three legs before they end. This is especially clear in triangles, and in wedges in particular. With triangles, the breakout is usually imminent but the direction is often not clear.

所有通道最终都会以突破结束，这种突破可能是剧烈的，也可能动量很小。

##### 趋势通道的持续时间与交易者的陷阱

趋势通道通常比大多数交易者预期的持续时间要长得多，它们常常会诱使交易者过早地进行反转交易，从而被困住。大多数通道通常在结束之前至少有三波走势。

---

##### 三角形与楔形的突破特点

这在三角形中尤为明显，特别是在楔形中。对于三角形来说，突破通常迫在眉睫，但方向往往不明确。

>The steeper the slope and the closer together the lines are, the stronger the channel is and the stronger the momentum is. When a channel is steep and tight, it is a special type of channel called a tight channel. When it is horizontal, it is a tight trading range, which is discussed in book 2. When a channel is strong, it is risky to trade the first breakout against the trend, and it is likely that the entire channel will be a spike on a higher time frame chart. So if there is a steep bear channel and most of the pullbacks within the channel have been only a single bar,it is better not to buy one of those breakouts above the prior bar, even if it breaks above the bear trend line. Instead, it is better to wait to see if there is a breakout pullback, which can be a lower low or a higher low. If there is and the reversal up looks strong (for example, maybe there were two or three good-sized bull trend bars within the past several bars), then you can consider buying the breakout pullback. If there is no pullback and the market races upward,then the odds of even higher prices are good and you can wait for any pullback, which should come within five bars or so. The odds of the long being profitable are better if the rally up goes above the moving average and that first pullback stays above the moving average. This is a sign of strength. If the first pullback forms below the moving average, the bulls are weaker and the chance of a second leg up is less. If the market continues to sell off after the upside breakout, the breakout failed and the bear trend is resuming.

##### 通道强度与动量

通道的斜率越陡峭，线条越紧密，通道就越强，动量也越强。当通道陡峭而紧密时，它是一种特殊类型的通道，称为**紧密通道（tight channel）**。当它是水平的，它就是一个紧密交易区间，这将在第二本书中讨论。

---

##### 强劲通道中的交易风险与策略

当通道很强时，逆着趋势交易第一次突破是冒险的，而且整个通道很可能在更高时间周期的图表上表现为一个急拉（spike）。

因此，如果有一个陡峭的看跌通道，并且通道内的大多数回调都只有一根 K 线，那么最好不要买入那些突破前一根 K 线高点的交易机会，即使它突破了看跌趋势线。相反，最好等待是否会出现**突破回调（breakout pullback）**，这可以是更低的低点或更高的高点。如果出现了，并且向上反转看起来很强劲（例如，在过去几根 K 线中有两三根大小合适的看涨趋势 K 线），那么你可以考虑买入突破回调。

如果价格没有回调，而是迅速上涨，那么价格继续走高的可能性很大，你可以等待任何回调，这应该会在五根 K 线左右出现。如果上涨突破移动平均线，并且第一次回调保持在移动平均线之上，那么做多盈利的可能性更大。这是一个强势的信号。如果第一次回调在移动平均线下方形成，则表明多头较弱，第二波上涨的机会较小。如果市场在向上突破后继续下跌，则突破失败，看跌趋势正在恢复。

>The strength of a channel is especially important when the market might be in the process of reversing. For example, if there is a strong bull trend and then there is a strong sell-off that breaks well below the bull trend line, traders will study the next rally carefully. They want to see whether that rally will simply be a test of the bull high or will instead break out strongly above the high and be followed by another strong leg up in the bull trend. One of the most important considerations is the momentum of that test of the bull high. If the rally is in a very tight, steep channel with no pullbacks and very little overlap between the bars, and the rally goes far above the bull high before having any pause or pullback, the momentum is strong and the odds are increased that the bull trend will resume, despite the strong sell-off and breakout below the bull trend line. Usually the first breakout of a tight, prolonged channel will fail. The trend will then resume and often break out to a new extreme and reach a measured move equal to about the height of that initial breakout.

##### 通道强度在反转过程中的重要性

当市场可能处于反转过程中时，通道的强度尤为重要。

---

##### 研判反弹：是测试还是趋势延续？

例如，如果有一个强劲的牛市趋势，然后出现一次强劲的抛售，并远低于牛市趋势线，交易者会仔细研究随后的反弹。他们想看看这次反弹是仅仅是对牛市高点的测试，还是会强劲突破高点，并随后在牛市趋势中再走出强劲的一波上涨。

最重要的考量之一是**测试牛市高点时的动量**。如果反弹发生在一个非常紧密、陡峭的通道中，没有回调， K 线之间重叠很少，并且反弹远高于牛市高点才出现任何停顿或回调，那么动量是强劲的。在这种情况下，尽管出现了强劲的抛售和跌破牛市趋势线的突破，牛市趋势恢复的可能性也会增加。

---

##### 紧密通道的突破模式

通常，**紧密、持久通道的第一次突破会失败**。然后趋势会恢复，并且常常突破到新的极端，达到一个**等幅测量目标**，其幅度大约等于最初突破的高度。

>By contrast, if the rally has many overlapping bars, several large bear trend bars, two or three clear pullbacks, maybe a wedge shape, and a slope that is noticeably less than the slope (momentum) of the original bull trend and of the sell-off, the odds are that the test of the bull high will result in either a lower high or a slightly higher high and then another attempt to sell off. The market might be reversing into a bear trend, but at a minimum a trading range is likely.

##### 反之，如果反弹表现疲软

相反，如果反弹具有以下特征：

- 许多**重叠的 K 线**。
    
- 几根大型**看跌趋势 K 线**。
    
- 两到三个明显的**回调**。
    
- 可能呈**楔形**。
    
- **斜率明显小于**原始牛市趋势和抛售的斜率（动量）。
    

那么，对牛市高点的测试很可能会导致一个**更低的高点**或一个**略高的高点**，然后是另一次抛售尝试。市场可能正在反转进入看跌趋势，但至少很可能会出现一个交易区间。

>Whenever there is a breakout of any channel and then a reversal back into the channel, the market will try to test the other side of the channel, and will usually try to break out of it, at least by a little. If there is a successful breakout of the channel in either direction, the next minimum objective is a measured move equal to about the height of the channel. For example, a double top is a horizontal channel and if there is a successful breakout of the downside, the minimum target is a measured move equal to the height of the channel.However, the breakout can become a trend reversal and the move can be much greater. If instead the breakout is to the upside, the target is again a measured move up equal to the height of the double top. If AAPL is forming a double top and the top of the pattern is $5.00above the bottom, the initial target of any breakout to the upside is $5.00 above the top. If the breakout instead is to the downside, the initial objective is $5.00 below the low of the pattern.The same is true for a wedge bottom. The first objective is a test of the top of the wedge. If the market continues up, the next target is a measured move up. If the rally continues, the market might then be in a bull trend. Even when a channel is sloping, the initial objective is a move equal to the height of the channel. In a bull channel, for example, pick any bar and look at the channel lines directly above and below. Simply measure how far apart they are to get the measured move projection. The measured move targets are only approximate, but the market often hits them exactly and then pauses, pulls back, or reverses. If the market goes much beyond the target, a new trend is likely underway.

##### 通道突破后的反转与目标

每当任何通道出现突破，然后反转回到通道内时，市场都会尝试测试通道的另一侧，并且通常会尝试突破出去，即使只是突破一点点。

---

##### 成功突破后的最小目标

如果通道向任何方向成功突破，下一个最小目标是**一个等于通道高度的等幅测量移动**。

例如，一个双顶是一个水平通道，如果向下成功突破，最小目标是一个等于通道高度的等幅测量移动。然而，突破可能演变为趋势反转，并且移动幅度可能更大。如果向上突破，目标同样是一个等于双顶高度的等幅测量上涨。

---

##### 等幅测量目标的具体计算

如果苹果（AAPL）正在形成一个双顶，并且形态顶部比底部高 $5.00，那么任何向上突破的初始目标是顶部上方 $5.00。如果向下突破，初始目标是形态低点下方 $5.00。

楔形底部也是如此。第一个目标是测试楔形顶部。如果市场继续上涨，下一个目标是一个等幅测量上涨。如果反弹持续，市场可能就会进入牛市趋势。

即使通道是倾斜的，初始目标也是一个等于通道高度的移动。例如，在一个看涨通道中，选择任何一根 K 线，查看正上方和正下方的通道线。简单测量它们之间的距离即可获得等幅测量预测。

---

##### 测量目标值的特性

等幅测量目标只是近似值，但市场经常精确触及它们，然后暂停、回调或反转。如果市场远超目标，很可能正在形成一个新的趋势。

>As with all breakouts, three things can then happen: it can be successful and be followed by more trading in that direction; it can fail and become a small climactic reversal; or the market can just go sideways and the pattern can evolve into a trading range. Most breakouts have an attempt to reverse within a few bars. If the reversal bar is strong compared to the breakout bar, the odds of a failed breakout and a successful reversal are good. If the reversal bar is weak compared to the breakout, the odds are that the reversal attempt will fail and set up a breakout pullback within a bar or two, and the breakout will resume. If the breakout and the reversal are about equally strong, traders will then look at the bar after the reversal signal bar.For example, if there is a strong bull trend bar that breaks out of a bull flag, and the next bar is an equally impressive bear reversal bar, the bar that follows becomes important. If it trades below the bear reversal bar, the breakout has failed, at least for the moment. If it then has a strong bear close and is a strong bear trend bar, the chance that the reversal will continue down increases. If instead it is a strong bull reversal bar, chances are that the failed breakout will not succeed, and this bull reversal bar then becomes a signal bar for a breakout pullback buy at one tick above its high. Breakouts are discussed in book 2.

##### 突破的三种可能结果

与所有突破一样，随后可能会发生三件事：

1. **成功并延续：** 突破成功，并沿着该方向继续交易。
    
2. **失败并反转：** 突破失败，成为一个小的、高潮式的反转。
    
3. **横向整理：** 市场只是横向移动，形态演变为一个交易区间。

##### 反转尝试的强度判断

大多数突破都会在几根 K 线内尝试反转。

- **反转 K 线强劲：** 如果反转 K 线相对于突破 K 线强劲，那么突破失败和反转成功的可能性很高。
    
- **反转 K 线疲弱：** 如果反转 K 线相对于突破 K 线疲弱，那么反转尝试很可能会失败，并在一两根 K 线内形成一个突破回调，然后突破会继续。
    
- **突破与反转强度相当：** 如果突破和反转的强度大致相等，交易者会观察反转信号 K 线之后的 K 线。

##### 突破与反转的后续 K 线判断

例如，如果有一根强劲的看涨趋势 K 线突破了看涨旗形，而下一根 K 线是同样令人印象深刻的看跌反转 K 线，那么随后的 K 线就变得很重要。

- **跌破反转 K 线：** 如果它跌破看跌反转 K 线，那么突破就失败了，至少暂时是这样。如果它随后以强劲的看跌收盘，并且是一根强劲的看跌趋势 K 线，那么反转继续下跌的可能性增加。
    
- **强劲看涨反转 K 线：** 如果它反而是一根强劲的看涨反转 K 线，那么失败的突破就不太可能成功，这根看涨反转 K 线就成为一个突破回调买入的信号 K 线，入场点在其高点上方一个跳动点。

突破将在第二本书中讨论。


>Channels are common on all charts, and some smaller channels are nested inside of larger channels. In Figure 15.1, notice that the lines do not always have to be drawn to contain all of the highs and lows in the channel. Drawing them with best fit lines helps to make the channel behavior clearer and often makes it easier to anticipate signals. Since most trading is institutional and placed by computer programs, it is reasonable to assume that each small,tight channel is due to program trading. Since there are so many firms running programs all day long, a channel probably can develop only when several firms are running programs in the same direction and with enough volume to overwhelm the programs that are trying to make the market move in the opposite direction. For example, in the channel down from bar 4, there were enough sell programs going on to overpower any buy programs, and the market moved down. When the buy and sell programs are largely in balance, the market moves sideways in a tight trading range, which is a horizontal channel.

##### 通道的普遍性与嵌套结构

通道在所有图表上都很常见，一些较小的通道嵌套在较大的通道内部。

在图 15.1 中，请注意这些线并不总是必须绘制成包含通道内的所有高点和低点。使用最佳拟合线绘制有助于使通道行为更清晰，并且通常更容易预测信号。

---

##### 程序化交易与通道形成

由于大多数交易是机构性的并由计算机程序执行，因此可以合理地假设每个小的、紧密的通道都是由于**程序化交易**造成的。

由于有如此多的公司全天候运行程序，通道的形成可能只有在**几家公司朝着相同的方向运行程序并拥有足够的交易量来压倒试图使市场向相反方向移动的程序**时才能发生。

例如，从 K 线 4 开始的下跌通道中，有足够的卖出程序压倒了任何买入程序，市场因此下跌。当买入和卖出程序大致平衡时，市场会横向移动，形成一个紧密的交易区间，这是一种水平通道。

>Bull channels are indistinguishable from bear flags, and bear channels should be thought of as bull flags. When the channel is tight like from bars 2 to 3, buyers should wait until there is a failed breakout and reversal up before looking for longs, as occurred at bar 3. They could also wait for a pullback after the breakout, like the buying above the high of the small bar that formed five bars after bar 3.

##### 通道与旗形的关系

看涨通道与看跌旗形无法区分，而看跌通道则应被视为看涨旗形。

---

##### 紧密通道的交易策略（以看跌通道为例）

当通道非常紧密，例如从 K 线 2 到 K 线 3 的情况，买家应该等待出现**失败的向下突破并向上反转**之后再寻找做多机会，就像 K 线 3 发生的那样。他们也可以在突破后等待回调，例如在 K 线 3 之后的第五根小 K 线高点上方买入。

>Until either of these develop, traders should only be shorting. When a channel has broader swings like the channel from bars 3 to 8, trades can be taken in both directions, since it more clearly resembles a sloping trading range and trading ranges are two-sided markets that give both buy and sell signals.
>Most of the channels in the chart were tight, and since several had no pullbacks or small (only one- to three-tick) one-bar pullbacks and lasted about 10 bars or less, they were also micro channels.

---

##### 通道不同阶段的交易策略

在出现上述两种情况（失败的向下突破并向上反转，或突破后的回调）之前，交易者应该**只做空**。

当通道具有更宽的摆动，例如从 K 线 3 到 K 线 8 的通道，可以**双向交易**，因为它更清晰地类似于一个倾斜的交易区间，而交易区间是双向市场，既提供买入信号也提供卖出信号。

---

##### 微型通道的特征

图表中大多数通道都很紧密，并且由于其中几个没有回调或只有很小的（一到三个跳动点）单 K 线回调，持续时间大约 10 根 K 线或更少，它们也属于**微型通道**。

>When there is a breakout of a channel and then a reversal back into the channel, the market usually tests the opposite side of the channel and often breaks out of the other side, at least minimally. If the breakout has follow-through, the first target is a measured move equal to the height of the channel. In Figure 15.2, bar 3 broke out of the top of a trading range and reversed back down. After breaking through the bottom of the channel, the bar 4 low was one tick below a perfect measured move.

##### 通道突破后的反转与目标

当通道出现突破，然后反转回到通道内时，市场通常会测试通道的另一侧，并且经常会从另一侧突破，至少是微小突破。如果突破有后续，第一个目标是**等于通道高度的等幅测量移动**。

---

##### 图 15.2 的案例分析

在图 15.2 中，K 线 3 突破了一个交易区间的顶部并反转回落。在跌破通道底部后，K 线 4 的低点比一个完美的等幅测量目标低了一个跳动点。

![[Pasted image 20250702002834.png]]

>Bar 11 broke above the top of a trading range and then the market tested the bottom of the range with bar 13. Sometimes there are several bars to choose from when drawing the lines,and it is usually worth being aware of all of the possibilities because you may not know which is best until several bars later. The widest channel is the most certain.

---

K 线 11 突破了一个交易区间的顶部，然后市场在 K 线 13 处测试了区间的底部。

##### 绘制通道线的考量

有时在绘制通道线时会有多根 K 线可供选择，通常值得留意所有可能性，因为你可能要等到几根 K 线之后才能知道哪一条是最好的。**最宽的通道是最确定的**。

>The bull inside bar that followed the bar 13 breakout set up a failed breakout buy. Since the market was again reversing into the channel, the first target was a test of the top of the channel. The breakout of the top was successful and the next target was a measured move up.Bar 22 went one tick above that target. Sometimes a trend will begin and carry much further.
>Bar 17 broke above a bull micro channel or wedge and reversed back down on the next bar.Since the channel was so tight, the objective of testing the lower end of the channel was met on that next bar, but there was not enough room for a profitable short and no trade should be taken.
>The measured move up for the breakout of the channel formed by bars 19 and 20 was at the same price as the measured move up from the trading range defined by bars 6 and 10. When multiple targets are around the same price, any reversal there has an increased chance of success. Bar 21 was a valid short setup but it failed on the bar after entry. There was a second entry below bar 22 and the market tested the bottom of the channel. There, it formed a bull reversal bar and the market then tested the top of the channel.

##### K 线 13 突破后的“失败突破买入”交易机会

K 线 13 突破后出现的看涨内包 K 线，形成了一个**失败突破买入**的交易机会。由于市场再次反转进入通道，第一个目标是测试通道的顶部。顶部的突破是成功的，下一个目标是一个等幅测量上涨。K 线 22 刚好比这个目标高了一个跳动点。有时一个趋势会开始并走得更远。

---

##### K 线 17 突破后的微型通道或楔形

K 线 17 突破了一个看涨微型通道或楔形，并在下一根 K 线反转下跌。由于通道非常紧密，测试通道下边缘的目标在下一根 K 线就达到了，但没有足够的空间进行有利可图的做空交易，因此不应进行交易。

---

##### 多重目标汇聚与交易机会

由 K 线 19 和 K 线 20 形成的通道的等幅测量上涨目标，与由 K 线 6 和 K 线 10 定义的交易区间的等幅测量上涨目标价格相同。当多个目标汇聚在同一价格附近时，在该处发生的任何反转成功率都会增加。

K 线 21 是一个有效的做空**交易机会**，但在入场后的 K 线失败了。K 线 22 下方有一个二次入场，市场测试了通道底部。在那里，它形成了一个看涨反转 K 线，随后市场测试了通道顶部。
