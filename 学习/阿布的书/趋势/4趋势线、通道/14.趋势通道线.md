>In a bull or bear channel, the trend channel line is on the opposite side of the price action from the trend line and has the same general slope. In a bull trend, a trend line is below the lows and a trend channel line is above the highs, and both are rising up and to the right. A trend channel line is a useful tool for fading a trend that has gone too far, too fast. Look for an overshoot that reverses, especially if it is the second penetration that is reversing.

在牛市或熊市通道中，趋势通道线位于价格行为的另一侧，并具有大致相同的斜率。
##### 牛市中的趋势通道线
在牛市趋势中，**趋势线**在低点下方，而**趋势通道线**在高点上方，两者都向上并向右倾斜。
##### 趋势通道线的用途
趋势通道线是一个有用的工具，用于对那些**走得太远、太快**的趋势进行逆势交易。寻找**反转的超调**，特别是如果它是第二次穿透后反转的情况。

>A trend channel can have roughly parallel lines, or the lines can be convergent or divergent.When they converge and the channel is rising or falling, the channel is a wedge and this often sets up a reversal trade. In general, any channel that is sloping up to the right can be thought of as a bear flag and it is likely that there will be a breakout through the bottom of the channel. The breakout can lead to a trend reversal or to a trading range that can break out to the upside or the downside.  Sometimes the market will accelerate to the upside and break out of the top of the channel. When this happens, it is usually a climactic rally that leads to a reversal back into and often through the bottom of the channel, but sometimes it can be the start of another leg up in an even stronger bull trend.

趋势通道的线条可以是大致平行的，也可以是收敛或发散的。

---
##### 通道的形态与交易机会

当通道收敛且呈上升或下降趋势时，这种通道就是**楔形**，这通常会形成一个**反转交易机会**。

一般来说，任何向上倾斜的通道都可以被视为**看跌旗形**，很可能会向下突破通道底部。这种突破可能导致趋势反转，或者进入一个交易区间，该区间可能向上或向下突破。

---
##### 通道上方的突破

有时，市场会加速上涨并突破通道顶部。当这种情况发生时，通常是一个**高潮式上涨**，导致价格反转回到通道内，并经常会跌破通道底部。但有时，这也可以是更强劲的牛市中下一波上涨的开始。

>Similarly, a channel that slopes down to the right can be thought of as a bull flag and the market will likely break out of the channel to the upside. This can be the start of a trend reversal or a trading range. If the market falls through the bottom of a falling channel, the breakout will usually fail within about five bars and lead to a reversal, but it can also be the start of a new, stronger bear leg.

##### 下降通道的解读与交易机会

同样，一个**向下倾斜的通道**可以被视为一个**看涨旗形**，市场很可能会向上突破通道。这可以是一个趋势反转的开始，或者进入一个交易区间。

如果市场跌破下降通道的底部，突破通常会在大约五根 K 线内失败并导致反转，但它也可能是一个新的、更强劲的看跌腿的开始。

>A trend channel line can be created as a parallel of a trend line that is then dragged to the opposite side of the price action. It can also be drawn across spikes on the opposite side of the channel, or it can be drawn as a best fit line, like a linear regression line or by simply visually drawing a best fit line. In a bull trend, a trend line is drawn across two lows. If that trend line is used to create a parallel that will be used for a trend channel line, drag the parallel line to the opposite side of the trend. You want it to contain (be above) the highs of all of the bars located in between the two bars used to create the trend line, so drag it to the high of whatever bar will leave it touching that bar alone. Occasionally you will get a better sense of the trend if you anchor the line to a bar that is outside of the two bars. Always do whatever best highlights the trend.

##### 绘制趋势通道线的方法

趋势通道线可以通过以下几种方式创建：
1. **平行于趋势线：** 可以先创建一条趋势线的平行线，然后将其拖动到价格行为的另一侧。
2. **连接通道另一侧的尖峰：** 直接连接通道另一侧的最高点（或最低点）。
3. **最佳拟合线：** 可以像线性回归线那样，或者仅仅通过目视方式绘制一条最佳拟合线。

---
##### 牛市趋势通道线的具体绘制

在牛市趋势中，趋势线是连接两个低点绘制的。如果使用这条趋势线来创建一条作为趋势通道线的平行线，你需要将这条平行线拖动到趋势的另一侧。

目标是让这条线能够**包含**（即位于上方）所有位于创建趋势线的两个 K 线之间的 K 线高点。因此，将其拖动到能够刚好触及其中一个最高点的 K 线高点。

---
##### 灵活调整以突出趋势

偶尔，如果你将趋势通道线锚定在两个用于绘制趋势线之外的 K 线，你可能会对趋势有更好的理解。

**永远选择最能突出趋势的绘制方法**。

>Sometimes there will be a single spike up within an otherwise fairly tight channel, and when that is the case, it is usually best to ignore it and use the other bars for the location of the trend channel line. However, be aware of the possibility that the market might ultimately decide that the channel line should instead be across that spike up. If the market begins to have wider swings and they all are stopping at the top of the channel that uses that one spike as the anchor for the trend channel line, then you should use that wider channel.

有时，在一个相当紧密的通道内会出现一个**单独的向上尖峰**。在这种情况下，通常最好忽略它，并使用其他 K 线来确定趋势通道线的位置。

---
##### 尖峰对通道线的影响与调整

然而，请注意市场最终可能会决定趋势通道线应该穿过那个尖峰。如果市场开始出现更宽的摆动，并且它们都停在以该尖峰为锚点的通道顶部，那么你应该使用那个更宽的通道。

>A trend channel line can also be created on its own, rather than as a parallel of the trend line.In a bear swing, a trend line will be downward sloping and above the highs. The trend channel line will have a similar slope, but draw it between any two swing lows in the bear swing. It is most useful if it contains (is below) all of the other bars in the swing, so choose the bars that will give that result.
##### 独立创建趋势通道线

趋势通道线也可以独立创建，而不是作为趋势线的平行线。

在一个看跌的摆动中，趋势线将是向下倾斜并位于高点上方。趋势通道线也将具有相似的斜率，但这次是**在看跌摆动中的任意两个摆动低点之间绘制**。

如果这条线能够**包含**（即位于下方）摆动中所有其他 K 线，那么它将是最有用的，因此请选择能达到这个结果的 K 线来绘制。

>Trend channel line overshoots are closely related to wedges and should be viewed and traded as if they are one and the same. Most wedges have failed trend channel line breakouts as the trigger for a reversal trade, and most trend channel line overshoots and reversals are also wedge reversals, although the wedge may not be obvious or have a perfect wedge shape. The wedges are less obvious and less likely to be present when the trend channel line is constructed as a parallel of a trend line, but wedges are still often present.

趋势通道线的**超调（overshoots）** 与**楔形（wedges）**密切相关，它们应该被视为并按照相同的方式进行交易。

---
##### 超调与楔形的关系

大多数楔形都是以**失败的趋势通道线突破**作为反转交易的触发点，而大多数趋势通道线的超调和反转也都是楔形反转，尽管该楔形可能不那么明显或不具有完美的楔形形状。

当趋势通道线是作为趋势线的平行线构建时，楔形就不那么明显，也更不容易出现，但**楔形仍然经常存在**。

>When a channel has a wedge shape, it is due to urgency. For example, in a wedge top, the slope of the trend line is greater than the slope of the trend channel line. The trend line is where the with-trend traders enter and the countertrend traders exit, and the opposite happens at the trend channel line. So if the slope of the trend line is greater, that means that the bulls are buying on smaller pullbacks and the bears are exiting on smaller sell-offs. What first distinguishes a wedge from a channel where the lines are parallel is the second pullback.Once the second push up has begun to reverse down, traders can draw a trend channel line and then use it to create a parallel line. When they drag that parallel line to the bottom of the first pullback, they have created a trend line and a trend channel. That tells bulls and bears where support is, and bulls will look to buy there and bears will look to take profits there.However, if the bulls begin to buy above that level and the bears exit their shorts early, the market will turn back up before it reaches the trend line. Both are doing so because they feel a sense of urgency and are afraid that the market will not drop down to that support level. This means that both feel that the trend line needs to be steeper and that the trend up is stronger.

当一个通道呈现**楔形**时，是由于**紧迫感**造成的。
##### 楔形顶部的形成与市场心理

例如，在一个**楔形顶部**中，趋势线的斜率大于趋势通道线的斜率。
- **趋势线**是顺势交易者入场和逆势交易者离场的地方。
- **趋势通道线**则是情况相反的地方。

因此，如果趋势线的斜率更大，这意味着多头在更小的回调中买入，而空头在更小的抛售中离场。

---
##### 楔形的识别与演变

最初区分楔形与平行通道的关键是**第二次回调**。一旦第二次上涨开始反转下跌，交易者就可以绘制一条趋势通道线，然后用它来创建一条平行线。当他们将这条平行线拖到第一次回调的底部时，就创建了一个趋势线和一个趋势通道。这会告诉多头和空头支撑位在哪里，多头会寻求在那里买入，空头会寻求在那里获利了结。

---
##### 紧迫感对价格行为的影响

然而，如果多头开始在那个水平上方买入，而空头提前退出他们的空头头寸，市场就会在到达趋势线之前掉头向上。这两种行为都源于他们感到一种**紧迫感**，担心市场不会跌到那个支撑位。这意味着双方都认为趋势线需要更陡峭，并且上涨趋势更强劲。

>Once the market turns up, traders can redraw the trend line. Instead of using the parallel of the trend channel line, they now can draw a trend line using the bottoms of the first two pullbacks. They now see that it is steeper than the trend channel line above and they begin to believe that the market is forming a wedge, which they know is often a reversal pattern.Traders will draw a parallel of that new steeper trend line and drag it to the top of the second push up, in case the market is forming a steeper parallel channel instead of a wedge. Both the bulls and the bears will watch to see whether the original trend channel line will contain the rally or the new, steeper one will be reached. If the original one contains the rally and the market turns down, traders will think that although there was more urgency in the buying on the second pullback, that urgency did not continue on the third push up. The bulls took profits at the original, shallower trend channel line, which means that they exited earlier than they could have. The bulls were hoping that the market would rally to the steeper trend channel line but now are disappointed. The bears were so eager to short that they were afraid that the market would not reach the steeper, higher trend channel line so they began to short at the original line. Now it is the bears who have a sense of urgency and the bulls who are afraid. Traders will see the turn down from the wedge top and most will wait for at least two legs down before they look for the next major pattern to buy or sell.

一旦市场开始上涨，交易者就可以重新绘制趋势线。
##### 楔形的形成与心理变化

他们现在不再使用趋势通道线的平行线，而是可以利用**前两次回调的底部**来绘制一条趋势线。他们会发现这条线比上方的趋势通道线更陡峭，并开始相信市场正在形成一个**楔形**，而他们知道这通常是一个反转形态。

交易者还会绘制这条新的、更陡峭趋势线的平行线，并将其拖动到第二次上涨的顶部，以防市场形成一个更陡峭的平行通道而非楔形。多头和空头都会观察，看看最初的趋势通道线是否能限制住反弹，还是市场会触及新的、更陡峭的通道线。

---
##### 交易者的情绪博弈

如果最初的通道线限制了反弹并且市场开始下跌，交易者会认为尽管第二次回调时的买盘更具紧迫感，但这种紧迫感并未延续到第三次上涨。多头在最初的、较平缓的趋势通道线处获利了结，这意味着他们比本可以更早地退出了。多头原本希望市场能反弹到更陡峭的趋势通道线，但现在感到失望。空头如此急于做空，以至于他们担心市场不会触及更陡峭、更高的趋势通道线，于是他们开始在最初的线上做空。现在，**空头有了紧迫感，而多头则感到恐惧**。

交易者会看到从楔形顶部开始的下跌，大多数人会等待至少两波下跌，然后才会寻找下一个主要的买入或卖出形态。

>Once the market makes its first leg down, it will break below the wedge. At some point, the bears will take profits and the bulls will buy again. The bulls want to cause the wedge top to fail. When the market rallies to test the wedge top, the bears will begin to sell again. If the bulls begin to take profits, they believe that they will be unable to push the market above the old high. Once their profit taking, combined with the new selling by the bears, reaches a critical mass, it will overwhelm the remaining buyers and the market will turn down for that second leg. At some point, the bulls will return and the bears will take profits, and both sides will see the two-legged pullback and wonder if the bull trend will resume. At this point, the wedge has played itself out and the market will be looking for the next pattern.

一旦市场走出第一波下跌，它将跌破楔形。在某个时候，空头会获利了结，而多头会再次买入。多头希望导致楔形顶部失败。当市场反弹测试楔形顶部时，空头将再次开始卖出。

---
##### 楔形顶部失败的动态

如果多头开始获利了结，他们相信自己无法将市场推高到旧高点之上。一旦他们的获利了结，加上空头的新卖盘，达到一个临界点，它将压倒剩余的买家，市场将开始第二波下跌。

---
##### 趋势的转换与新形态的寻找

在某个时候，多头会回归，空头会获利了结，双方都会看到这个两波回调，并思考牛市趋势是否会恢复。

至此，**楔形已经发挥了它的作用，市场将寻找下一个形态**。

>Why do so many reversals occur after a trend channel line overshoot when everyone knows that it commonly leads to a reversal? Won't early entrants prevent the line from ever being reached? Common wisdom is that novice traders on the wrong side hold their losing positions until they cannot stand any more pain, and then suddenly all of them exit at once, creating a blow-off or a parabolic climax. For example, in a bull channel, the market works its way up to some resistance level, even if it is not very apparent or impressive, and pokes through it,causing the last shorts to no longer be willing to take the pain. They suddenly give up. As soon as these last shorts cover in unison, many euphoric, inexperienced bulls see the upsurge and buy into it, adding to the sudden, sharp move that breaks above the trend channel line. This spike up causes more remaining shorts to cover, and the impressive upsurge causes more naive bulls to initiate new longs, with the process feeding on itself. But then there are not enough shorts left who will cover and move the market higher, and those euphoric bulls who were trading on emotion rather than logic will panic when the market suddenly stops accelerating up, pauses, and starts to turn down. They suddenly realize that they bought at the high of a possible climax and will be quick to exit. With no more buyers left and with trapped new longs panicking to sell out of their positions, the market suddenly becomes one-sided and dominated by sellers so that it can only go down. That is the conventional logic and it is not important whether it is true. In fact, it is likely not a meaningful component of a reversal in a huge market like the Eminis where institutions dominate and most of the trading is probably computer generated. Smart traders won't trade countertrend until either there is a pullback from a strong trend line break or there is a reversal from a trend channel line overshoot. For example, in a bull trend, smart money will keep buying until they drive the price above the bull trend channel line and then they will take profits. There may be a couple of failed attempts to reverse, and the market may continue to rally at an accelerated pace,creating steeper trend channel lines. Incidentally, if you find yourself redrawing trend channel lines repeatedly, this is usually a sign that you are on the wrong side of the market. You are looking for a reversal but the trend keeps getting stronger. You should be trading with the trend instead of intensely looking for a reversal.

这是一个关于市场行为和交易者心理的深刻问题，尤其是在面对趋势通道线超调时的反转现象。让我们来剖析一下：

##### 为什么超调后会发生反转？

你提出一个很好的问题：既然大家都知道趋势通道线超调通常会导致反转，为什么早期的入场者不能阻止它被触及呢？

传统的逻辑，也就是你提到的“新手交易者坚持亏损头寸直到无法忍受，然后突然集体平仓，导致吹顶或抛物线式高潮”的说法，认为这是由被困交易者的痛苦和新入场者的狂热共同造成的。

- **新手被困：** 在看涨通道中，市场向上突破某个阻力位，即便它不明显，也会促使最后的空头因无法承受痛苦而突然平仓。
- **狂热多头加入：** 这些空头集体平仓的瞬间，许多狂热、缺乏经验的多头看到价格飙升，便盲目追涨买入，进一步加剧了突破趋势通道线的急剧上涨。
- **自我强化：** 这种飙升又促使更多剩余的空头平仓，而令人印象深刻的上涨也吸引更多天真的多头开立新多头头寸，这个过程不断自我强化。

---

##### 传统逻辑的局限性

然而，这种传统的逻辑可能并非完全真实，尤其是在像 Emini 这种机构主导、大部分交易由计算机生成的巨大市场中，它可能不是导致反转的重要组成部分。

真正的关键在于**市场动能的耗尽**和**聪明资金的策略**：

1. **缺乏后续买盘/卖盘：** 当被困的交易者（例如空头）已经大部分平仓后，就没有足够的“燃料”来继续推动市场向更高的方向发展了。
2. **情绪化交易者的恐慌：** 那些基于情绪而非逻辑进行交易的狂热多头，当市场突然停止加速上涨、暂停并开始转向下跌时，他们会感到恐慌。他们会突然意识到自己可能在高潮点买入了，并会迅速止损离场。
3. **卖方主导：** 随着没有足够的买家剩下，以及被困的新多头恐慌性地卖出平仓，市场突然变得单边，并被卖家主导，因此只能下跌。

---

##### 聪明交易者的策略

聪明交易者不会轻易逆势交易，直到他们看到明确的信号：
- **强劲趋势线突破后的回调：** 他们会等待价格强势突破趋势线后出现回调。
- **趋势通道线超调后的反转：** 例如，在牛市中，聪明资金会持续买入，直到价格突破牛市趋势通道线，然后他们会开始获利了结。

市场可能最初会出现几次反转失败的尝试，甚至可能以更快的速度继续上涨，从而形成更陡峭的趋势通道线。

---
##### 反复重绘趋势线的警示

值得注意的是，如果你发现自己**反复重绘趋势通道线**，这通常是一个迹象，表明你可能站错了市场方向。你可能一直在寻找反转机会，但趋势却持续走强。在这种情况下，你应该顺势交易，而不是执着于寻找反转。

>Eventually the market will agree on which trend channel line is the final one and you will see a convincing reversal. Be patient and trade only with trend until then; never trade against the trend until it has clearly reversed. At the same time as the profit takers are taking profits,many will reverse and many other traders who were already flat will initiate shorts. Other smart traders will wait for a reversal on the charts and there will be traders entering on reversals on all types of charts (1 to 5 minute, and volume charts and tick charts of any size).

市场最终会就哪条趋势通道线是最终的达成共识，然后你就会看到一个令人信服的反转。在那之前，请保持耐心，**只顺应趋势进行交易**；在趋势明确反转之前，绝不要逆势交易。

---
##### 市场反转时的交易行为

当获利了结者平仓时，许多人会反手做空，还有许多已经空仓的交易者会开立新的空头头寸。其他聪明的交易者会等待图表上出现反转，并且在各种类型的图表上（1 到 5 分钟图，以及任何大小的成交量图和跳动点图）都会有交易者在反转时入场。

>Once they believe that the top is in, this smart money won't be looking to buy any longer.They are short and most of these traders will hold through a new high, despite an open loss on their current position, believing that the top is in or close to in. In fact, many will add on above the high, both to get a better average price for their shorts and to help push the market down. The big players are only thinking short and won't be scared out except by the rare occurrence of a failed second entry or a huge failure (for example, maybe three points above their entry in the Emini). There are no buyers left, so the market only has one way to go.

一旦他们相信顶部已经形成，这些聪明的资金就不再会寻找买入机会了。他们已经做空，并且大多数这类交易者即使当前头寸出现浮亏，也会持有空头头寸突破新高，因为他们相信顶部已经形成或即将形成。

---
##### 聪明的交易者的策略与市场走向

事实上，许多人会在新高点上方加仓，这既是为了获得更好的空头平均价格，也是为了帮助推动市场下跌。大玩家只想着做空，除非极少数情况下出现失败的二次入场或巨大的失败（例如，Emini 市场可能上涨到他们入场点上方约三点），否则他们不会被吓跑。

---

市场已经没有买家，所以**只有一条路可走——下跌**。

>Although you do not need to look at volume when deciding whether to place a trade since it is so unreliable, it is often huge at key turning points, especially at bottoms. Every trade is between one or more institutions buying and one or more selling. The major buyers at a market bottom are the profit taking bears and the new longs. Why would a firm ever sell at the bottom tick of a bear market? Every firm uses strategies that they have carefully tested and found to be profitable, but all lose money on 30 to 70 percent of their trades. The firms selling at the low tick are the ones who were selling at the low tick all the way down in the bear,making profits on many of their earlier entries, and they simply continue to use those strategies until it is clear that the trend has reversed. So, yes, they lose on that short at the final low tick of the bear, but make enough from all of their earlier shorts to end up profitable.There are also HFT firms that will scalp for even a single tick right down to the low tick of the bear. Remember, the low is always at a support level, and many HFT firms will short a tick or two above support to try to capture that final tick, if their systems show that this is a profitable strategy. Other institutions sell as part of a hedge in another market (stocks,options, bonds, currencies, etc.) because they perceive that their risk/reward ratio is better if they place the hedge. The volume is not from small individual traders, because they are responsible for less than 5 percent of the volume at major turning points. The reversal at an overshoot happens because it is such an entrenched part of institutional trading psyche that it has to happen. Even if institutions do not look at charts, they will have some other criterion that tells them that the market has gone too far and it is time to exit or reverse, and this will invariably coincide with what price action traders are seeing. Remember, price action is the inescapable footprint of what is happening to price as a huge number of smart people are independently trying to make the most money they can in the market. In a big market, the price action cannot be manipulated and will always be basically the same.

尽管你在决定是否下单时不需要关注成交量，因为它非常不可靠，但在关键的转折点，特别是底部，成交量往往会非常巨大。

---
##### 市场底部成交量的成因

每笔交易都发生在一个或多个机构买方与一个或多个机构卖方之间。市场底部的**主要买家**是**获利了结的空头**和**新开多头头寸的交易者**。

那么，为什么会有公司在熊市的最低点卖出呢？每家公司都使用经过仔细测试并被证明有利可图的策略，但所有公司在 30% 到 70% 的交易中都会亏损。在最低点卖出的公司，是那些在熊市一路下跌过程中都在最低点卖出的公司，他们在早期的许多入场点都获得了利润，他们只是继续使用这些策略，直到趋势明确反转。所以，是的，他们在熊市的最终最低点做空会亏损，但从所有早期的空头交易中获得的利润足以让他们最终盈利。

---
##### 高频交易与对冲基金的作用

还有一些高频交易（HFT）公司，甚至会在熊市的最低点附近进行一两个跳动点的短线交易。记住，低点总是处于支撑位，许多高频交易公司会在支撑位上方一两个跳动点做空，试图捕捉最后的跳动点，如果他们的系统显示这是一个有利可图的策略。

其他机构卖出则是作为在其他市场（股票、期权、债券、货币等）进行**对冲**的一部分，因为他们认为如果进行对冲，他们的风险/回报比会更好。

---
##### 机构交易与价格行为的本质

成交量不是来自小散户交易者，因为他们在主要转折点所占的成交量不到 5%。**超调后的反转之所以会发生，是因为它已经根深蒂固地成为机构交易心理的一部分，它必然会发生。** 即使机构不看图表，他们也会有其他标准告诉他们市场已经走得太远，是时候退出或反转了，而这总是会与价格行为交易者所看到的一致。

请记住，**价格行为是大量聪明人独立地试图在市场中赚取最大利润时，价格变化的必然足迹**。在一个庞大的市场中，价格行为是无法被操纵的，并且总是基本相同的。

>One final minor observation is that the slope of the final flag of a trend often provides an approximation of the slope of the new trend. This has limited value to a trader because there will be other much more important factors involved in the decision leading up to placing a trade, but it is an interesting observation.
##### 最终旗形斜率的观察

最后一个小观察是，一个趋势的**最终旗形（final flag）的斜率**通常可以近似反映新趋势的斜率。

---

这个观察对于交易者来说**价值有限**，因为在决定下单之前，会有许多其他更重要的因素需要考虑，但这确实是一个有趣的观察。

>A trend channel line points in the direction of the trend but is on the opposite side of the trend from the trend line. Extend it to the right and watch how the price acts when it penetrates the channel line. Does it reverse or does the trend accelerate, ignoring the line?

##### 趋势通道线与价格行为

趋势通道线指向趋势的方向，但它位于趋势的另一侧（与趋势线相对）。将其向右延伸，并观察价格在穿透通道线时如何表现。
- 价格是反转了？
- 还是趋势加速，忽略了这条线？

>Trend channel lines are commonly drawn in one of two ways. The first way is to draw it as a parallel line (dashed lines in Figure 14.1) of a trend line (solid lines), drag it to the opposite side of the action, and place it to touch a swing point located between the two bars used to create the trend line. Choose the point that will result in all of the bars between the trend and channel lines being contained between the lines. The second type (dotted lines in Figure 14.1)of a trend channel line is drawn across swing points and is independent of any trend line. You can also simply draw a best fit, but these are usually not helpful in trading.

##### 趋势通道线的两种常见绘制方法

趋势通道线通常以两种方式中的一种绘制：

1. **作为趋势线的平行线（图 14.1 中的虚线）：** 这种方法是先绘制一条趋势线（实线），然后将其平行复制并拖动到价格行为的另一侧，放置在用于创建趋势线的两根 K 线之间的一个摆动点上。选择那个点是为了确保趋势线和通道线之间的所有 K 线都被包含在这两条线之间。
2. **独立绘制（图 14.1 中的虚线）：** 第二种类型的趋势通道线是直接连接摆动点来绘制，独立于任何趋势线。

你也可以简单地绘制一条“最佳拟合”线，但这些在交易中通常帮助不大。

![[Pasted image 20250701213947.png]]

>The slope of the final flag of the bull trend provided direction for the subsequent bear trend in Figure 14.2. A linear regression trend line drawn between bars 1 and 2 became a rough bear trend channel line for the sell-off that extended into the next day. It is possible that it contributed to the buying at bar 7, but bar 7 was a buy simply based on the break of the trend line drawn over the first hour of trading, and the second attempt to reverse the breakout below the bar 5 low of the open. It is usually far better to place orders based on the most recent price action if it provides a justification for a trade than to look back 30 or more bars.

##### 最终旗形斜率的指导作用（图 14.2）

在图 14.2 中，牛市趋势的最终旗形斜率，为随后的熊市趋势提供了方向。

---
##### 线性回归趋势线的应用

在 K 线 1 和 K 线 2 之间绘制的线性回归趋势线，成为了延续到第二天抛售的粗略看跌趋势通道线。

它有可能对 K 线 7 的买盘有所贡献，但 K 线 7 的买入仅仅是基于：

1. 突破了交易第一个小时绘制的趋势线。
2. 第二次尝试反转对 K 线 5 开盘低点的突破。
3. 
---
##### 交易决策的焦点

通常，如果最近的价格行为能够为交易提供依据，那么根据它来下单要远比回溯 30 根或更多 K 线更好。

![[Pasted image 20250701214154.png]]

>In hindsight, the bull trend effectively ended at bar 1, even though the market made a higher high after bar 2. The move down to bar 2 was the first leg down in the bear channel.

##### 回顾性分析：牛市趋势的终结

事后来看，尽管市场在 K 线 2 之后创下了更高的高点，但牛市趋势实际上在 **K 线 1** 处就已结束。

---

跌向 K 线 2 的走势是熊市通道中的第一波下跌。
