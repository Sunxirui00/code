8.柱线关闭的重要性>If the high of the current bar is above the high of the previous bar and the low is below the low of the previous bar, then the current bar is an outside bar. Outside bars are complicated to read because both the bulls and the bears were in control at some point within the bar or the prior bar, and there are many subtleties in their analysis. The increased size of the bar means that bulls and bears are willing to be more aggressive, but if the close is near the middle, it is essentially a one-bar-long trading range. In fact, by definition, since an outside bar totally overlaps the prior bar, every outside bar is a part of a trading range, which is two or more bars that largely overlap. At other times, they can act as reversal bars or trend bars. Traders must pay attention to the context in which they occur.

如果当前 K 线的高点高于前一根 K 线的高点，并且低点低于前一根 K 线的低点，那么当前 K 线就是一根 **外包 K 线（outside bar）**。

##### 外包 K 线的解读

外包 K 线解读起来很复杂，因为在当前 K 线或前一根 K 线内部的某个时间点，多头和空头都曾占据主导地位，其分析存在许多微妙之处。K 线尺寸的增加意味着多头和空头都愿意更具攻击性，但如果收盘价接近中间位置，它本质上就是一个 **单 K 线交易区间**。

事实上，从定义上讲，由于外包 K 线完全覆盖了前一根 K 线，因此每根外包 K 线都是 **交易区间的一部分**——即两根或更多根 K 线大部分重叠的区域。在其他时候，它们可以充当 **反转 K 线** 或 **趋势 K 线**。交易者必须关注它们出现的上下文。

>Traditional technical analysis teaches that outside bars are setup bars for a breakout in either direction, and that you should put an entry stop above and below. Once filled, double the size of the unfilled stop and make it a reversal order. However, it is almost always unwise to enter on a breakout of a 5 minute outside bar, especially if the outside bar is large, because of the greater risk that the distant stop entails. Sometimes they occur when you are looking for a major reversal and you are very confident that there will be a large, strong reversal. When that happens, it makes sense to enter as soon as the bar takes out the extreme of the prior bar. If you are less certain, you can wait for the bar to close and then enter on the breakout of the outside bar. If you did enter on the breakout of an outside bar and the protective stop is too large, consider using a money stop (like two points in the Emini) or trading fewer contracts.Since an outside bar is a one-bar trading range and it is better to not buy at the top of a sideways market or sell below it, it is usually best to not enter on a breakout of the bar.

传统技术分析认为，**外包 K 线** 是一个在任一方向上进行突破的交易机会，你应该在其上方和下方放置入场止损单。一旦一个订单被成交，将未成交止损单的规模翻倍，并将其设为反转订单。

然而，**在 5 分钟外包 K 线的突破处入场几乎总是不明智的**，特别是当外包 K 线很大时，因为遥远的止损意味着更大的风险。

---

##### 何时考虑外包 K 线的突破入场？

有时，当你在寻找一次主要的趋势反转，并且你非常确信将会有一次大幅而强劲的反转时，外包 K 线会出现。在这种情况下，一旦 K 线突破前一根 K 线的极端点，立即入场是合理的。如果你不太确定，可以等待 K 线收盘，然后在外包 K 线的突破处入场。

如果你在外包 K 线的突破处入场，但保护性止损过大，可以考虑使用 **资金止损**（例如 Emini 中的两点）或交易更少的合约。

---

##### 为什么通常不建议在外包 K 线突破处入场？

由于外包 K 线是一个 **单 K 线的交易区间**，并且在横向市场中最好不要在顶部买入或在底部卖出，因此通常最好不要在外包 K 线的突破处入场。

>Outside bars can be reliable entry bars if the bar before them was a good signal bar. For example, if a trader is looking to buy at the bottom of a bear swing and the market forms a strong bull reversal bar but the next bar trades below the bar, the trader should consider leaving the buy stop in the market. If the bar suddenly reverses back above the bull signal bar,the buy stop will be triggered and the current bar will become an outside bar and an entry bar.In general, traders should not enter a reversal trade on an outside bar unless the bar before it was a decent signal bar.

**外包 K 线** 可以在它们之前的 K 线是一个好的信号 K 线时，成为可靠的入场 K 线。

---

##### 外包 K 线作为入场点的示例

例如，如果一个交易者希望在熊市摆动的底部买入，并且市场形成了一个强劲的看涨反转 K 线，但下一根 K 线却跌破了这根 K 线，那么交易者应该考虑将买入止损订单留在市场中。如果该 K 线突然反转回看涨信号 K 线之上，买入止损订单将被触发，并且当前 K 线将成为一个**外包 K 线**和入场 K 线。

总的来说，交易者不应该在**外包 K 线**上进行反转交易，除非它之前的 K 线是一个不错的信号 K 线。

>Sometimes you have to enter on an outside bar (not on its breakout) because you know that traders are trapped. This is especially true after a strong move. If an outside bar occurs as the second entry in a strong reversal from a trend line break or trend channel line overshoot, it can be an excellent entry bar. For example, if the market just sold off below a swing low for the second time and reversed up from a trend channel line overshoot, you are likely looking to buy and you keep moving a buy stop order to one tick above the prior bar's high until you get filled. Sometimes the fill will be on an outside up bar. This is usually a good reversal trade and it is due to strong buyers.

有时，你必须在一个**外包 K 线**上（而不是在其突破处）入场，因为你清楚地知道交易者被困住了。在一次强劲的走势之后，这种情况尤其常见。

---

##### 外包 K 线作为绝佳入场点的场景

如果一个**外包 K 线**作为第二次入场，出现在趋势线突破或趋势通道线超调后的强劲反转中，那么它可能是一个极好的入场 K 线。例如，如果市场刚刚第二次跌破摆动低点，并从趋势通道线超调处反转上涨，你很可能正在寻找买入机会，并且不断将买入止损订单移动到前一根 K 线高点上方一个跳动点，直到被成交。有时，成交将发生在上涨的**外包 K 线**上。这通常是一个很好的反转交易，并且是由于强劲的买家介入。

>If an outside bar is in the middle of a trading range, it is meaningless and should not be used to generate trades, unless it is followed by a small bar near the high or low of the outside bar,setting up a fade. An outside bar in a trading range just reaffirms what everyone already knows—that both sides are balanced and both will sell near the top of the range and buy near the bottom, expecting a move toward the opposite end of the outside bar. If the market instead breaks out in the other direction, just let it go and look to fade a failed breakout of the outside bar, which commonly happens within a few bars. Otherwise, just wait for a pullback (a failed breakout that fails is a breakout pullback setup).

如果一个**外包 K 线**出现在交易区间的中间，它是没有意义的，不应该用来生成交易，除非它后面跟着一个靠近**外包 K 线**高点或低点的**小 K 线**，形成一个逆势交易机会。

---

##### 交易区间中**外包 K 线**的解读

交易区间中的**外包 K 线**仅仅再次确认了每个人都知道的事实——即多空双方处于平衡状态，双方都会在区间顶部附近卖出，并在底部附近买入，预期会向**外包 K 线**的另一端移动。

如果市场反而向另一个方向突破，就让它走，并寻找逆势交易**外包 K 线**的失败突破，这种情况通常在几根 K 线内发生。否则，就等待回调（一个失败后又失败的突破是**突破回撤交易机会**）。

>If the bar after the outside bar is an inside bar, then this is an ioi pattern (inside-outside-inside) and can be a setup for an entry in the direction of the breakout of the inside bar.However, take the entry only if there is a reason to believe that the market could move far enough to hit your profit target. For example, if the ioi is at a new swing high and the second inside bar is a bear bar that closes near its low, a downside breakout could be a good short since it is likely a second entry (the first entry probably occurred as the outside bar traded below the low of the bar before it). If it is in barbwire (a tight trading range), especially if the inside bar is large and near the middle of the outside bar, it is usually better to wait for a stronger setup.

如果**外包 K 线**之后的 K 线是**内包 K 线**，那么这就构成了一个 **ioi 模式 (内包-外包-内包)** 。这可以是一个沿着**内包 K 线**突破方向入场的交易机会。

---

##### 何时考虑 ioi 模式入场

然而，**只有当你认为市场有足够的空间触及你的止盈目标时，才应该入场**。

例如，如果 ioi 模式出现在新的摆动高点，并且第二个**内包 K 线**是一根看跌 K 线，收盘价接近其低点，那么向下突破可能是一个好的做空机会，因为它很可能是 **二次入场** (第一次入场可能发生在**外包 K 线**跌破其前一根 K 线的低点时)。

如果它处于 **“铁丝网”区域（一个紧密的交易区间）**，特别是当**内包 K 线**较大且靠近**外包 K 线**中部时，通常最好等待更强的交易机会。

>When a with-trend outside bar occurs in the first leg of a trend reversal and the prior trend was strong, it functions like a strong trend bar and not a trading range type of bar. For example, in a bear trend, if there is a strong reversal up, traders might start looking for more of a rally.Many traders will be looking to buy above the high of a higher low, and fewer traders will short below the low of the prior bar. If the bulls are especially aggressive, they will buy below the low of the prior bar instead of waiting to buy above its high, and they will keep buying for the next several minutes as more and more traders see that the bulls have taken control of the market. This will make the bar extend above the high of that prior bar. Once it does, it becomes an outside up bar and those bears who just shorted below the low of the prior bar will likely cover and not be eager to short again for at least a couple of bars. With very few bears and many aggressive bulls, the market is one-sided and likely to go up at least for a bar or two. Everyone suddenly agrees about the new direction and therefore the move will have so much momentum and extend so far that it will likely get tested after a pullback, creating a second leg up. This higher low, and not the actual bear low, is the start of the up leg because it is when the market suddenly agreed that the next leg is up and not down. There will usually be two legs up from the bottom of the outside bar. Although the swing up will appear as three legs up from the actual bear low on the chart, it functionally is only two legs up since the market did not agree about the bull move until the higher low formed rather than at the actual low. This is where it became clear that the bulls had seized control.

当一个 **顺应趋势的外包 K 线** 出现在趋势反转的第一波走势中，并且之前的趋势强劲时，它的功能更像是 **强趋势 K 线**，而不是交易区间类型的 K 线。

---

##### **顺应趋势外包 K 线** 的多头控制示例

例如，在一个熊市趋势中，如果出现强劲的反转上涨，交易者可能会开始期待更大幅度的反弹。许多交易者会寻找在更高低点的高点上方买入，而较少交易者会在前一根 K 线的低点下方做空。

如果多头特别激进，他们会在前一根 K 线的低点下方买入，而不是等待在其高点上方买入，并且在接下来的几分钟内持续买入，因为越来越多的交易者看到多头已经控制了市场。这将导致 K 线延伸到前一根 K 线的高点之上。一旦发生这种情况，它就变成了 **外包向上 K 线**，而那些刚刚在前一根 K 线低点下方做空的空头很可能会平仓，并且至少在接下来的几根 K 线内不会再急于做空。

*多头占据主导*

---

##### 市场共识与第二波上涨

在极少空头和众多激进多头的情况下，市场呈 **单边走势**，很可能至少上涨一到两根 K 线。每个人突然都对新方向达成共识，因此这次上涨将具有如此大的动能并延伸如此之远，以至于在回调后很可能会被测试，从而形成 **第二波上涨**。

这个更高的低点，而不是实际的熊市低点，才是上涨波段的起点，因为正是在这个点，市场突然同意下一波是上涨而不是下跌。通常，从**外包 K 线**的底部开始会有两波上涨。尽管从图表上的实际熊市低点来看，向上摆动将表现为三波上涨，但从功能上讲，它只有两波上涨，因为直到更高的低点形成时，市场才就看涨走势达成一致，而不是在实际低点形成时。这正是多头掌控局面变得清晰的地方。

*被确认过的更高的低点，是下一个趋势的起点，市场看到了反转的意图的强劲*

>Why is the move often strong? The old bears who shorted below the low of the prior bar, in what they thought would be just another bear flag, became trapped. Then their entry bar quickly reversed to an outside bar up, trapping the bears in and trapping the bulls out. Many bulls were trapped out because they don't like entering as outside bars are forming since many outside bars just lead to trading ranges. Invariably, the market will trend up hard for many more bars as everyone realizes that the market has reversed and they are trying to figure out how to position themselves. The bears are hoping for a dip so they can exit with a smaller loss, and the bulls want the same dip so they can buy more with limited risk. When everyone wants the same thing, it will not happen because both sides will start buying even two- or three-tick pullbacks, preventing a two- or three-bar pullback from developing until the trend has gone very far. Smart price action traders will be aware of this possibility at the outset, and if they are looking for a two-legged extended up move, they will watch the downside breakout of that bear flag carefully and anticipate its failure. They will place their entry orders just above the high of the prior bar, even if it means entering on an outside bar up (especially if it is the entry bar for the shorts).

当 **顺应趋势的外包 K 线** 出现时，市场走势往往会非常强劲。这是因为：

---

##### 1. 空头被困

那些在前一根 K 线低点下方做空的旧空头，原本以为那只是又一个看跌旗形，结果却发现自己被困住了。他们的入场 K 线很快反转成 **外包向上 K 线**，这不仅困住了空头（因为他们被套牢），也让一些多头望而却步（因为许多**外包 K 线**只会导致交易区间，多头不喜欢在**外包 K 线**形成时入场）。

---

##### 2. 市场形成共识

随着所有人意识到市场已经反转，并且都在设法调整自己的仓位，市场会不可避免地强劲上涨许多 K 线。空头希望出现回调，以便能以较小的损失离场；多头也希望出现同样的回调，以便能以有限的风险买入更多。

---

##### 3. 期望一致导致回调不发生

当所有人都想要同样的回调时，这种情况通常不会发生。这是因为多空双方都会开始买入哪怕是两到三个跳动点的回调，从而阻止两到三 K 线的回调形成，直到趋势已经走得很远。

---

##### 4. 聪明交易者的预判

聪明的价格行为交易者从一开始就会意识到这种可能性。如果他们正在寻找一个两波延伸的上涨走势，他们会仔细观察那个看跌旗形的向下突破，并预判其失败。他们会将入场订单放置在前一根 K 线高点上方，即使这意味着在 **外包向上 K 线** 上入场（特别是如果它是空头的入场 K 线）。

*“他们会仔细观察那个看跌旗形的向下突破，并预判其失败。”这里看出继续向下突破的失败，才是核心能力*
*这里的止损可能会比较宽，因为是一个趋势k线的外包k线的上方入场，下方止损。相对的，这里的盈亏比很高，会有一次三波的上涨*
*如果在更高的低点，回测起涨点时入场，入场位置可能更好，但是可能等不到这种机会，因为期望回调的人太多*

>If you think about this from an institution's perspective, you will want the bear flag short to trigger so that there will be longs who are trapped out and who will chase the market up, and also new shorts who will be trapped in and will have to cover if the bear breakout fails. This is an ideal situation for the institution that wants and expects a rally. So, as an institution, what can you do to contribute to this? Don't buy aggressively until after the trap. In fact, you try to create the trap by selling until the short entry is triggered and then you buy aggressively as all those bear traders get short and the longs exit with losses just below the low of the prior bar.You take the opposite side of their positions and buy heavily below the low of the prior bar!Once you've trapped them all, you can buy aggressively all the way up; they will chase the market up once they see the trap, and this will propel the market upward with everyone in agreement that the market is heading higher.

从机构的角度来看，他们会希望看跌旗形做空被触发，这样就能**困住那些被排除在市场之外的多头**（迫使他们追涨），以及**困住那些新进场的空头**（如果看跌突破失败，他们将被迫平仓）。对于那些希望并预期市场反弹的机构来说，这是一种理想的情况。

---

##### 机构如何促成这种局面？

作为机构，你可以这样做：

1. **在陷阱形成之前不激进买入。** 事实上，你会尝试通过卖出制造陷阱，直到做空入场被触发。
2. **在空头进场和多头止损平仓时激进买入。** 当所有看跌交易者做空，并且多头在前一根 K 线低点下方止损离场时，你恰好站在他们的对立面，在**前一根 K 线低点下方大量买入**！

一旦你成功困住他们，你就可以一路激进买入；当他们意识到被困后，就会追涨市场，这将推动市场上涨，所有人都认同市场将走高。

>The single most important thing to remember about outside bars is that whenever a trader is uncertain about what to do, the best decision is to wait for more price action to develop.
>Outside bars are risky, and traders have to pay careful attention to the price action that led to them.

关于**外包 K 线**，最重要的一点是：无论何时，当交易者不确定如何操作时，最好的决定就是等待更多的价格行为出现。

**外包 K 线**具有风险，交易者必须仔细关注导致它们出现的价格行为。

>In Figure 7.1, bar 1 was an outside up bar in a strong bear trend, so traders would be looking to enter only on a downside breakout. You could either short below bar 1 or wait to see what the breakout bar looks like after it closes. Here, it was a strong bear trend bar, and trapped longs will likely exit below such a strong bear trend bar. Because of this, it makes sense to short below the low of that bear bar.

在图 7.1 中，K 线 1 是一个处于强劲熊市趋势中的**外包向上 K 线**，因此交易者只会寻求在向下突破时入场。

##### K 线 1 的做空策略

你可以选择在 K 线 1 的下方做空，或者等待观察突破 K 线收盘后的形态。在这里，它是一根强劲的看跌趋势 K 线，被困的多头很可能会在这种强劲的看跌趋势 K 线下方离场。因此，在**这根看跌 K 线的低点下方做空是合理的**。

>Bar 5 was an outside down bar but the market was basically sideways with lots of overlapping bars, so it was not a reliable setup for a breakout entry. The inside bar that followed it (ioi) was too large to use as a breakout signal, because you would be either selling at the bottom of a trading range or buying at the top and you only want to buy low or sell high.

K 线 5 是一个**外包向下 K 线**，但市场基本上处于横盘整理状态，伴随着大量重叠的 K 线，因此它不是一个可靠的突破入场交易机会。

---

##### ioi 模式的局限性

紧随其后的**内包 K 线**（ioi 模式）过大，不适合作为突破信号使用。因为那样你将要么在交易区间的底部卖出，要么在顶部买入，而你只想在低点买入或在高点卖出。
