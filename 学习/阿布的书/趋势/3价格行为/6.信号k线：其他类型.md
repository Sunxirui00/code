>All signal bars are meaningless in the absence of price action that indicates that the breakout of the bar will likely go far enough for at least a profitable scalp.

所有信号K线，如果缺乏**市场背景**来表明K线突破可能足以带来至少一次盈利的剥头皮交易，那么它们都是毫无意义的。

>A very important signal bar is a strong trend bar, especially during the spike phase of a trend.For example, if the market just broke above a bottom at an area of major support on a major news item that will affect the market for days, traders will look for any reason to get long. One common approach is to wait for a bar to close and if the bar is a strong bull trend bar, traders will buy at the market as soon as the bar closes. Many will try to quickly place a limit order at the price of the close, and if their order is not filled within a few seconds, they will change it to a market order. Other traders will enter on a stop at one tick above the high of the bar. This urgency results in a series of bull trend bars and an increasingly larger bull spike.

一个非常重要的信号K线是**强劲的趋势K线**，尤其是在趋势的**急涨阶段**。

举例来说，如果市场刚刚因一条将影响市场数天的大新闻而突破了主要支撑区域的底部，交易者会寻找任何理由做多。一种常见的方法是等待一根K线收盘，如果这根K线是一根**强劲的看涨趋势K线**，交易者会在K线收盘后立即市价买入。许多人会尝试快速在收盘价挂限价单，如果订单在几秒钟内没有成交，他们会将其改为市价单。其他交易者则会在K线高点上方一个跳动点设置止损单入场。

这种紧迫感导致了一系列看涨趋势K线的出现，并形成一个不断扩大的**看涨急涨**。

>Traders are always looking for a change of direction, and they rely on reversal patterns as the earliest sign that a change might be taking place. The risk is to the opposite end of the bar and the reward is often several times greater.

交易者总是在寻找方向的改变，他们依赖**反转模式**作为可能发生变化的**最早迹象**。风险在K线的另一端，而回报通常是风险的数倍。

>When there is a strong trend that might be reversing into a trading range or into an opposite trend, traders will want a strong reversal setup, which is often simply called a reversal. This is because trends are resistant to change and if traders are to bet on a move in the opposite direction, they will want a strong sign that the market is about to reverse. However, if there is a strong trend and then a pull-back, traders are so confident that the trend will resume that they will not require a strong reversal setup at the end of the pullback. In fact, the majority of signal bars for trend pullback trades look weak. If a pullback setup looks perfect and easy, it usually means that the trend is not strong. So many traders would take it that it often becomes the final flag in the trend, leading to a bigger correction. Trends require traders to keep missing entries so there is a constant tension, a constant desire to get in, and one of the ways that trends accomplish this is through weak signal bars.  For example, if there is a two-legged pullback to the moving average in a strong bull trend, traders might be willing to buy above the high of the prior bar even if it is a bear trend bar and not a strong bull reversal bar.They are afraid that the pullback will reverse back into the direction of the bull trend and the rally might quickly accelerate. They wanted a pullback so they could buy at a lower price, and now that they have one, they want to be sure that they buy before the breakout from the bull flag goes very far. All traders have this sense of urgency, which is why the rally to a new high is often very fast. Traders who did not take the trade because the signal looked weak will remain eager to buy, and many will keep buying in small pieces all the way up, just to be certain that they have at least a small position. Trapped shorts keep waiting for a deeper correction and a clearer buy signal to let them out with a smaller loss, but one never comes and they have to keep buying back their shorts in pieces as the trend continues higher. Most trends eventually have at least a minor climax before a deeper correction comes, and the climax is usually due to the weak traders finally entering late and the last traders on the wrong side finally exiting.When no traders are left on the wrong side, the sense of urgency disappears and the market usually enters a trading range, at least for a while.

当出现一个可能反转进入交易区间或相反趋势的强劲趋势时，交易者会希望看到一个**强劲的反转交易机会**，这通常简称为反转。这是因为趋势具有抗拒改变的特性，如果交易者要押注相反方向的走势，他们会希望有强烈的迹象表明市场即将反转。

然而，如果有一个强劲的趋势，然后出现一次回调，交易者对趋势将恢复的信心如此之高，以至于他们**不会要求在回调结束时出现一个强劲的反转交易机会**。事实上，大多数趋势回调交易的信号K线看起来都很弱。

如果一个回调**交易机会**看起来完美而容易，这通常意味着**趋势并不强劲**。会有如此多的交易者入场，以至于它常常成为趋势中的最后一个旗形，导致更大规模的修正。趋势需要交易者不断错过入场机会，从而产生一种持续的紧张感和强烈的入场欲望，而趋势实现这一点的方式之一就是通过**弱信号K线**。

例如，如果在一个强劲的牛市趋势中，市场出现两段式回调到移动平均线，交易者可能愿意在前一根K线的高点上方买入，即使它是一根看跌趋势K线，而不是一个强劲的看涨反转K线。他们担心回调会反转回牛市趋势的方向，并且涨势可能会迅速加速。他们想要一次回调以便能以更低的价格买入，而现在回调出现了，他们希望确保在牛旗突破走得很远之前就买入。所有交易者都有这种紧迫感，这就是为什么创新高后的涨势通常非常迅速。

那些因为信号看起来很弱而没有入场的交易者会继续渴望买入，许多人会一路小批量地持续买入，只是为了确保自己至少有一个小仓位。被套的空头则一直等待更深的回调和更清晰的买入信号，以便让他们以更小的损失出局，但这样的机会从未出现，他们不得不随着趋势的不断走高而被迫小批量地平掉空头仓位。

大多数趋势最终在更深层次的修正到来之前，都会经历至少一次小幅高潮，而这个高潮通常是由于那些**弱势交易者最终迟迟入场，以及最后那些站在错误一边的交易者最终离场**所致。当市场上不再有站在错误一边的交易者时，那种紧迫感就会消失，市场通常会进入一个交易区间，至少会持续一段时间。

>Two-bar reversals are one of the most common reversal setups and therefore are very important. It is useful to think of every reversal as a type of two-bar reversal because the phrase reminds traders that the market made a strong move in one direction and then a strong move in the opposite direction. The strongest moves usually begin with either a reversal bar or a two-bar reversal for the signal. This is why it is so important to be ready to place a trade when the setup occurs at a time when a strong move might follow. Two-bar reversals have many variations and are a part of every reversal, but they may not be apparent on the chart you are using. However, as long as you understand that the market is reversing, it is not necessary to look at many types of charts to find a perfect two-bar reversal or a perfect reversal bar, although they both are present in every reversal.

**两K线反转**是**最常见的反转交易机会**之一，因此非常重要。将每一次反转都视为某种类型的两K线反转是很有用的，因为这个说法提醒交易者，市场先是朝一个方向强劲移动，然后又朝相反方向强劲移动。

最强劲的走势通常都以**反转K线**或**两K线反转**作为信号开始。这就是为什么当**交易机会**出现，并且可能随后带来强劲走势时，做好下单准备如此重要。两K线反转有许多变体，并且是每一次反转的一部分，但它们可能不会在你正在使用的图表上明显体现出来。然而，只要你理解市场正在反转，就没有必要查看多种类型的图表去寻找一个完美的两K线反转或完美的反转K线，尽管它们确实存在于每一次反转中。

>The best-known version is a pair of consecutive 5 minute trend bars of approximately the same size but opposite directions. A long setup is a bear trend bar immediately followed by a bull trend bar, and a bear setup is a bull trend bar immediately followed by a bear trend bar.These two bars create a 10 minute reversal bar, but the reversal bar is evident on the 10minute chart only 50 percent of the time because only half of the 5 minute two-bar reversals will end at the same time as the 10 minute bar.The other half will result in some other usually less clear reversal on the 10 minute chart.

最广为人知的版本是两根连续的5分钟趋势K线，它们大小大致相同但方向相反。

一个做多的**交易机会**是，一根看跌趋势K线紧随一根看涨趋势K线之后；而一个做空的**交易机会**是，一根看涨趋势K线紧随一根看跌趋势K线之后。

这两根K线共同创造了一个10分钟的反转K线。然而，这个反转K线只有50%的几率会在10分钟图上明显体现出来，因为只有一半的5分钟两K线反转会与10分钟K线同时结束。另外一半则会在10分钟图上形成其他通常不太清晰的反转形态。

>It is important to realize that all climactic reversals, all reversal bars, and all two-bar reversals are exactly the same and all are present at all reversals, and you will be able to see them if you look at enough different types of charts. If you think about it, even a classic reversal bar is actually a two-bar reversal on some smaller time frame or on some other type of chart, like a tick or volume chart that uses the right number of ticks or shares per bar. Also, the two bars in opposite directions do not have to  be consecutive, and most of the time they are not.However, if you look at all possible higher time frame charts, you will be able to find one where the setup actually is a perfect two-bar reversal. You can almost always find one where it becomes a single reversal bar. Always be open to all possibilities because you will then find many more setups that you understand and have confidence to trade. The key is to recognize that a reversal is taking place, and you need to be aware of the many ways that it can appear.A bear reversal always has a bull trend bar, which is acting as a buy climax, followed before long by a bear trend bar, which is acting as a breakout to the downside. A bull reversal is the opposite, with a bear trend bar that is acting as a sell climax and then a bull trend bar that is acting as a bull breakout.

重要的是要认识到，**所有高潮式反转、所有反转K线以及所有两K线反转，本质上是完全相同的，并且都存在于每一次反转中**。如果你观察足够多不同类型的图表，你将能够看到它们。

仔细想想，即使是经典的**反转K线**，在某个更小的时间框架或某种其他类型的图表（比如使用正确跳动点数或每K线交易股数的跳动点图或成交量图）上，它实际上也是一个**两K线反转**。此外，两根方向相反的K线不一定是连续的，而且大多数情况下它们都不是连续的。

然而，如果你查看所有可能更高时间框架的图表，你将能够找到一个图表，其**交易机会**确实是一个完美的**两K线反转**。你几乎总能找到一个图表，使其成为一个单一的**反转K线**。

永远对所有可能性保持开放态度，因为这样你将找到更多你理解并有信心交易的**交易机会**。关键在于**识别反转正在发生**，你需要了解它可能出现的多种方式。

一次**看跌反转**总是先有一个**看涨趋势K线**（充当买盘高潮），然后不久紧跟着一个**看跌趋势K线**（充当下跌突破）。**看涨反转**则正好相反，先有一个**看跌趋势K线**（充当卖盘高潮），然后是一个**看涨趋势K线**（充当看涨突破）。

>A reversal bar can be the second bar of a two-bar reversal. When it overlaps more than about 75 percent of the prior bar, it is better to regard the two bars as a two-bar reversal setup rather than as a reversal bar. If you do so, the odds of a successful reversal trade are higher. For example, if the market is rallying and forms a bear reversal bar with a low that is one tick above the low of the prior bar, this is often a bear trap. The market frequently falls one tick below the bear reversal bar but not below the bull trend bar that preceded it, and then rallies to a new high within a couple of bars. This happens much less often if that bear entry bar falls below the low of both bars and not just below the low of the bear reversal bar. When the reversal bar overlaps the prior bar by too much, they form a two-bar trading range and the breakout entry is beyond the entire trading range. Since the trading range is only two bars long, the entry is beyond both bars, not just the second bar.

**反转K线**可以是**两K线反转**的第二根K线。当它与前一根K线重叠超过约75%时，最好将这两根K线视为一个**两K线反转交易机会**，而不是单纯的反转K线。如果你这样做，成功进行反转交易的几率会更高。

例如，如果市场正在上涨，并形成一根看跌反转K线，其低点比前一根K线的低点高一个跳动点，这通常是一个**熊市陷阱**。市场经常会跌破看跌反转K线的低点一个跳动点，但没有跌破其之前的看涨趋势K线，然后会在几根K线之内反弹创新高。

如果这个看跌入场K线跌破了两根K线的低点而不仅仅是看跌反转K线的低点，那么这种情况（指熊市陷阱）发生的频率会大大降低。当反转K线与前一根K线重叠过多时，它们就形成了一个**两K线交易区间**，而突破入场点位则在整个交易区间之外。由于这个交易区间只有两根K线长，所以入场点位在两根K线之外，而不仅仅是第二根K线之外。

>If that bear reversal bar falls below the prior bull trend bar, treat it like an outside bar, even if its high is below the high of the bull trend bar. In general, it is then better to wait for a pullback to a lower high before going short. Otherwise you are shorting so far below the top of the bull leg that there is too much risk that you might be shorting at some support level, like the bottom of a developing trading range, and the market might rally.

⭐如果那根看跌反转K线跌破了之前的看涨趋势K线，即使它的高点低于看涨趋势K线的高点，也要将其视为一根**外包K线**来处理。

通常来说，这种情况下最好等待市场出现一次回调形成一个**更低的高点**后再做空。否则，你做空的位置离牛市腿的顶部太远，风险太高，你可能正在某个支撑位（例如正在形成的交易区间底部）做空，市场随时可能反弹。

*在这个点做空，你面临的最大的风险是离顶部太远，可能处在一个（你看不出来的）支撑位上*

>There is a special type of two-bar reversal that signals a trade in the opposite direction. If there is a two-bar reversal that is sitting on or touching the bottom of the moving average and the two bars almost entirely overlap one or more prior bars, the breakout usually fails. If the market is in a strong trend, however, the signal will usually work, since almost any with-trend entry works in a strong trend. When there is not a strong trend, the signal usually fails even if there is a perfect two-bar reversal. Any three or more large, overlapping bars will do. For example, if there is a two-bar bull reversal just above the moving average and the bars are relatively large and mostly overlap a third or fourth bar, do not buy above the high of the signal bar. The market has formed a small trading range, and traders who are confident in their read of the overall price action can often short the market at or above the bull signal bar for a scalp down.

有一种特殊类型的**两K线反转**，它预示着一个相反方向的交易机会。

⭐如果出现一个**两K线反转**，它位于或触及移动平均线的底部，并且这两根K线几乎完全重叠前一根或多根K线，那么其**突破通常会失败**。

然而，如果市场处于**强劲趋势**中，这个信号通常会起作用，因为在强劲趋势中，几乎任何顺势入场都有效。当没有强劲趋势时，即使出现一个完美的两K线反转，该信号也通常会失败。

⭐任何三根或更多大尺寸、相互重叠的K线都会有这种效果。例如，如果在移动平均线上方出现一个**两K线看涨反转**，且这些K线相对较大并主要重叠了第三或第四根K线，那么**不要在信号K线的高点上方买入**。市场已经形成了一个小型交易区间，那些对整体价格行为解读有信心的交易者，通常可以在看涨信号K线处或其上方做空，以进行剥头皮交易。

*看似是反转，实则是交易区间*

>A three-bar reversal is just a variation of a two-bar reversal where there are three consecutive bars, with the first and third being the bars of a two-bar reversal and the middle bar being an unremarkable bar, like a small bar or a doji. This creates a 15 minute reversal bar when the third 5 minute bar closes at the same time as the 15 minute bar. When that happens, it is likely more reliable because it would then bring in traders who are trading off of 15 minute charts. In the two out of three times that it does not, the 5 minute signal usually results in some other 15minute reversal pattern. When looking for any 5 minute reversal entry, it is helpful to think about whether there are three consecutive bars that might also be forming a 15 minute reversal bar. If so, this should give you more confidence in your trade since a higher time frame signal is more likely to be followed by a larger move, and you might be more comfortable swinging more of your position and using a wider profit target. In general, traders should view them as simple two-bar reversals and not worry about whether they are also creating a 15 minute reversal bar.

**三K线反转（Three-bar reversal）** 只是**两K线反转**的一种变体，其中有三根连续的K线：第一根和第三根构成了两K线反转的K线，而中间的K线则是一根不起眼的K线，比如小型K线或十字星K线。

当第三根5分钟K线与15分钟K线同时收盘时，这三根K线就共同创建了一个15分钟的反转K线。当这种情况发生时，它可能更可靠，因为它会吸引那些交易15分钟图表的交易者。在三分之二没有发生这种情况的时候，5分钟的信号通常会在15分钟图上形成其他通常不太清晰的反转模式。

在寻找任何5分钟的反转入场机会时，思考是否有三根连续的K线也可能正在形成一个15分钟的反转K线会很有帮助。如果存在，这应该会给你更多的交易信心，因为更高时间框架的信号更有可能带来更大的走势，而且你可能会更放心地持有更多仓位并使用更宽的止盈目标。

总的来说，交易者应该将它们视为简单的两K线反转，不必过于担心它们是否同时也在创建一个15分钟的反转K线。

>Small BarsA bar that has a small range compared to the prior bars can be a reversal signal bar. Here are common examples:
>• An inside bar, which is a bar with a high below the high of the prior bar and a low at or above the low of the prior bar, or a low above the low of the prior bar and a high at or below the high of the prior bar. It is more reliable if it is small and has a body in the opposite direction of the current trend and less reliable if it is a large doji bar. In fact, a large doji is rarely a good signal bar even if it is an inside bar, and since it is a one-bar trading range, it is usually followed by more two-sided trading.
>• An ii (or iii) pattern, which is two consecutive inside bars with the second being inside of the first (an iii is made of three consecutive inside bars).
>• A small bar near the high or low of a big bar (trend bar or outside bar) or trading range (especially if its body is in the direction of your trade, indicating that your side has taken control).
>• An ioi pattern, which is an inside bar followed by an outside bar and then another inside bar (inside-outside-inside). 
>
>If it occurs in an area where a breakout seems likely, traders can enter on the breakout of that second inside bar. These are often breakout mode setups, meaning that the move can be in either direction, and it is often prudent to place a sell stop below and a buy stop above that second inside bar and enter in the direction of the breakout. The unfilled order then becomes the protective stop.Note that doji bars are rarely good signal bars because they are one-bar trading ranges and when the market is in a trading range, you should not be looking to buy above the high or go short below the low. They can be decent signal bars for reversal trades if they occur near the high or low of a trading range day, or if they are a with-trend setup in a strong trend. In a trading range, it can be fine to sell below a doji if the doji is at the high of the range, especially if it is a second entry. The bigger trading range trumps the tiny trading range represented by the doji bar, so selling below the doji bar is also selling at the top of a large trading range,which is usually a good trade.
>
>Outside Bar
>An outside bar is a bar with either its high or its low beyond that of the prior bar and the other extreme of the outside bar at or beyond the prior bar's extreme. See Chapter 7.

小型K线 (Small Bars)

相对于之前的K线而言，如果一根K线的**范围较小**，它也可以成为一个反转信号K线。以下是一些常见示例：

- **内包K线 (Inside Bar)：** 这是一种高点低于前一根K线高点，并且低点等于或高于前一根K线低点的K线；或者低点高于前一根K线低点，且高点等于或低于前一根K线高点。如果它本身很小，并且实体方向与当前趋势相反，则更为可靠；如果它是一个大型十字星K线，则可靠性较低。事实上，大型十字星K线很少是好的信号K线，即使它是内包K线，而且由于它是一个单K线交易区间，其后通常会有更多的双向交易。
- **ii (或 iii) 模式：** 连续两根内包K线，其中第二根K线被第一根K线所包含（iii模式由三根连续的内包K线组成）。
- **大型K线（趋势K线或外包K线）或交易区间高点/低点附近的小型K线：** （特别是如果其实体方向与你的交易方向一致，表明你方已经控制了局面）。
- **ioi 模式：** 一根内包K线，紧随一根外包K线，然后再接着一根内包K线（内包-外包-内包）。如果它出现在可能发生突破的区域，交易者可以在第二根内包K线的突破方向入场。这些通常是**突破模式交易机会**，意味着走势可能朝任意方向，⭐通常谨慎的做法是在第二根内包K线的下方设置卖出止损，上方设置买入止损，并根据突破方向入场。未成交的订单随后成为保护性止损。

请注意，**十字星K线（Doji Bar）** 很少是好的信号K线，因为它们是单K线交易区间，当市场处于交易区间时，你不应该在高点上方买入或在低点下方做空。⭐如果它们出现在**交易日的高点或低点附近**，或者在**强劲趋势中是顺势的交易机会**，它们可以成为不错的反转交易信号K线。在交易区间中，如果十字星K线处于区间高点，即使在它下方卖出也是可以的，特别是如果这是第二次入场。较大的交易区间会凌驾于由十字星K线代表的微小交易区间之上，因此在十字星K线下方卖出也是在较大交易区间的顶部卖出，这通常是一个好的交易。

外包K线 (Outside Bar)

**外包K线**是指其高点或低点超出了前一根K线的高点或低点，并且其另一个极端点位等于或超出了前一根K线的极端点位。详情请参阅第七章。

>Micro Double Bottom
>A micro double bottom is consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with identical or nearly identical lows. When it forms in a bear spike and it is a bear trend bar closing on or near its low and then a bull trend bar opening on or near its low, it is a one-bar bear flag. If the lows are identical, consider selling at one tick below the low. At all other times, it is more likely a reversal pattern, since most small bull reversals come from some type of micro double bottom (discussed in book 3).

微型双重底 (Micro Double Bottom)

**微型双重底**是指连续或几乎连续的K线，其低点相同或非常接近。

当它在一个**熊市急跌**中形成，并且是一根**收盘或接近低点的看跌趋势K线**，然后紧跟着一根**开盘或接近低点的看涨趋势K线**时，这是一个**单K线熊旗**。如果低点完全相同，可以考虑在低点下方一个跳动点做空。

在所有其他情况下，它更可能是一个**反转模式**，因为大多数小的看涨反转都来自某种类型的微型双重底（在第三本书中有讨论）。

>Micro Double Top
>A micro double top is consecutive or nearly consecutive bars with identical or nearly identical highs. When it forms in a bull spike and it is a bull trend bar closing on or near its high and then a bear trend bar opening on or near its high, it is a one-bar bull flag. If the highs are identical, consider buying at one tick above the high. At all other times, it is more likely a reversal pattern, since most small bear reversals come from some type of micro double top (discussed in book 3).

微型双重顶 (Micro Double Top)

**微型双重顶**是指连续或几乎连续的K线，其高点相同或非常接近。

当它在一个**牛市急涨**中形成，并且是一根**收盘或接近高点的看涨趋势K线**，然后紧跟着一根**开盘或接近高点的看跌趋势K线**时，这是一个**单K线牛旗**。如果高点完全相同，可以考虑在高点上方一个跳动点买入。

在所有其他情况下，它更可能是一个**反转模式**，因为大多数小的看跌反转都来自某种类型的微型双重顶（在第三本书中有讨论）。

>Reversal Bar Failure
>A reversal bar failure is the bar after a reversal bar that breaks out of the wrong side of the reversal (e.g., if there is a bear reversal bar in a bull trend and the next bar trades above its high instead of below its low).Shaved BarA shaved bar has no tail at one or both of its extremes. It is a setup only when it forms in a strong trend (e.g., in a strong bull trend, if there is a bull trend bar with no tail on its top or bottom, then it is a buy setup).

反转K线失败 (Reversal Bar Failure)

**反转K线失败**是指在反转K线之后的一根K线，其突破方向与反转方向相反（例如，如果在一个牛市趋势中出现一根看跌反转K线，但下一根K线交易在其高点之上，而不是在其低点之下）。

光头光脚K线 (Shaved Bar)

**光头光脚K线**是指在其一个或两个极端点位没有影线的K线。它只有在**强劲趋势**中形成时才是一个**交易机会**（例如，在一个强劲的牛市趋势中，如果出现一根顶部或底部没有影线的看涨趋势K线，那么它就是一个买入的**交易机会**）。

>Exhaustion Bar
>An unusually large trend bar in the direction of the trend can often represent an emotional exhaustion of a trend. All trend bars are spikes, breakouts, gaps, and climaxes or exhaustion bars, and sometimes the exhaustive component can be the dominant feature.
>
>Trend Bars
>Besides being signal bars for with-trend entries in strong trends, trend bars can also be signal bars for reversal trades, like a pullback reversing back in the direction of the trend, and for reversal trades in trading ranges. For example, if there is a strong bull trend and at least 20 consecutive bars have been above the moving average, and the market drifts sideways to the rising moving average, look to buy the close of the first small bear trend bar with a close that is only a tick or two below the moving average. Also, look to buy above its high. You are expecting the sideways to down correction to end and reverse back into the direction of the trend.

衰竭K线 (Exhaustion Bar)

一根异常大的、与趋势方向一致的趋势K线，常常可能代表着趋势的情绪**衰竭**。所有的趋势K线同时也是急涨、突破、缺口和高潮或衰竭K线，有时衰竭成分可能是主导特征。

⭐趋势K线 (Trend Bars)

除了在强劲趋势中作为**顺势入场的信号K线**之外，趋势K线还可以作为**反转交易的信号K线**，例如回调后反转回趋势方向，以及在交易区间内的反转交易。

举例来说，如果存在一个强劲的牛市趋势，并且至少连续20根K线都位于移动平均线之上，市场随后横盘漂移至上升的移动平均线，那么可以考虑在第一根小型看跌趋势K线收盘时买入，这根K线的收盘价仅比移动平均线低一两个跳动点。同时，也可以考虑在其高点上方买入。你预期横盘或下跌的修正即将结束，并反转回趋势方向。
*(可以理解为趋势中，横向的回调)*

### 通道中的

>If there is a clearly defined trading range with multiple reversals and there is a two-legged,two bull trend bar spike to a slightly new high in the middle of the day, this is often a good signal to go short at the market, especially if you can scale in higher and especially if it is a part of another pattern, like if it is at the top of a small wedge or if it is a test of a bear trend line. Also, if there is a two-legged sell-off in the trading range that forms a bear trend bar that closes below an earlier swing low in the trading range in the bottom half of the range, this can also be a signal to buy at the market, especially if you can add on lower or if it is part of another pattern, like the bottom of a wedge bull flag.

如果存在一个有多次反转的明确**交易区间**，并且在一天中间出现了两段式、两根看涨趋势K线急涨至一个略微新高的情况，这通常是一个**好的市价做空信号**，特别是如果你能分批在更高点入场，并且尤其当它是另一个模式的一部分时，例如它位于一个小型楔形的顶部，或者它是一个熊市趋势线的测试。

同样地，如果在交易区间内出现两段式下跌，形成了一根看跌趋势K线，其收盘价低于交易区间下半部分的早期摆动低点，这也可以是**市价买入的信号**，特别是如果你能分批在更低点加仓，或者它是一个其他模式的一部分，例如楔形牛旗的底部。

>When there is a strong bull channel, bulls will place limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar, and bears will place limit orders to short at or above the high of every bar and above every swing high. Bulls will also place buy stop orders above the highs of pullback bars,and the bears will place sell stop orders below the lows of bars at the top of the channel. The opposite is true in a bear channel.

当存在一个强劲的**看涨通道**时，多头会在前一根K线的低点处或下方设置**限价买单**；空头则会在每根K线的高点处或上方以及每一个摆动高点上方设置**限价卖单**。

多头还会**在回调K线的高点上方设置买入止损订单**；空头则会在通道顶部K线的低点下方设置卖出止损订单。在**看跌通道**中则情况相反。

>There are many types of small bars and many different situations in which they occur, and all represent a lack of enthusiasm from both the bulls and the bears. Each has to be evaluated in context. A small bar is a much better setup if it has a body in the direction of your trade (a small reversal bar), indicating that your side owns the bar. If the small bar has no body, it is usually better to wait for a second entry since the probability of a successful trade is much less and the chance of a whipsaw is too great.

小型K线是一种交易机会，它们出现在各种不同的市场情境中，都表示多头和空头双方的“缺乏热情”。每一种小型K线 都需要结合具体情况进行评估。

如果小型K线的实体部分与你的交易方向一致（即是一个小的反转条），那么它是一个更好的交易机会，因为它表明你的方向主导了该 K 线。

如果小型K线没有实体部分（例如十字星），通常最好等待第二次入场，因为成功交易的概率会大大降低，并且出现来回波动（whipsaw）的可能性太大了。

>An inside bar does not have to be totally inside (high below the prior bar's high, low above the prior bar's low). One or both of its extremes can be identical to that of the prior bar. In general,it forms a more reliable signal when it is a small bar and when its close is in the direction of the trade you want to take (it is always better to have bull signal bars when you are looking to buy and bear signal bars when you are looking to sell).

内包k线（inside bar）不一定需要完全在前一根 K 线的内部（即其高点低于前一根 K 线的高点，低点高于前一根 K 线的低点）。它的一端或两端可以与前一根 K 线的极端点相同。

通常来说，当内包k线是一个小型K线并且其收盘价与你希望进行的交易方向一致时，它会形成一个更可靠的信号（也就是说，当你在寻找买入机会时，最好有看涨的信号 K 线；当你在寻找卖出机会时，最好有看跌的信号 K 线）。

>When an inside bar occurs after a big trend bar that breaks out of a trading range, it could be simply a pause by the trend traders, but it could also be a loss of conviction that will lead to a reversal (failed breakout). A reversal is more likely when the small bar is an inside bar and it is a trend bar in the opposite direction of the large breakout bar. A with-trend inside bar increases the chances that the breakout move will continue, especially if the market had been trending in that direction earlier in the day (for example, if this might be the start of the second leg that you were expecting).

当一个内包k线出现在一个突破交易区间的大趋势 K 线之后，它可能仅仅是趋势交易者的一次暂停，但也可能意味着信念的丧失，从而导致反转（突破失败）。

如果这个小型K线是一个内包k线，并且其自身是一个与大突破 K 线方向相反的趋势 K 线，那么反转的可能性更大。

而一个顺应趋势的内包k线则增加了突破走势将继续的可能性，特别是如果市场在当天早些时候已经沿着该方向运行（例如，这可能是你所预期的第二波走势的开始）。

>Small inside bars after breakout trend bars are somewhat emotional for traders because they will consider entering in either direction on a stop and will have to process a lot of information quickly. For example, if there is a bull breakout during a down day, the trader will often place an order to buy at one tick above the high of the inside bar and a second order to sell at one tick below its low. Once one order is filled, the other order becomes the protective stop. If the order was filled on a breakout failure (i.e., on the sell order), the trader should consider doubling the size of the buy stop order, in case the failed breakout becomes a breakout pullback (opposite failures means that both the bulls and the bears were trapped, and this usually sets up a reliable trade). However, if the trader was first filled on the buy (with trend)order, he usually should not reverse on the protective stop, but might if the day had been a bear trend day. Once there has been a second or third bar without a failure, a failure that then occurs has a higher chance of simply setting up a breakout pullback entry in the direction of the new trend rather than a tradable failure. In general, good traders make quick, subjective decisions based on many subtle factors and if the process feels too confusing or emotional, it is better to not place an order, especially complicated orders like a pair of breakout orders or an order to reverse. Traders should not invest too much emotion in a confusing trade because they will likely be less ready to take a clear trade that may soon follow.

在突破趋势 K 线之后出现的小型内包k线对于交易者来说是有些情绪化的，因为他们会考虑在任一方向上设置止损进场，并且必须快速处理大量信息。

例如，如果在下跌日出现看涨突破，交易者通常会在内包k线高点上方一个跳动点处下达买入订单，并在其低点下方一个跳动点处下达卖出订单。一旦其中一个订单被成交，另一个订单就成为保护性止损。如果订单是在突破失败时成交的（即卖出订单），交易者应该考虑将买入止损订单的规模翻倍，以防突破失败演变成突破回撤（相反的失败意味着多头和空头都被困住，这通常会形成一个可靠的交易机会）。然而，如果交易者首先被买入（顺应趋势）订单成交，他通常不应该在保护性止损时反向操作，但如果当天是熊市趋势日，则可能会这样做。

一旦出现第二或第三根 K 线而没有失败，随后发生的失败更有可能仅仅是在新趋势方向上设置一个突破回撤的入场点，而不是一个可交易的失败。

总的来说，优秀的交易者会根据许多细微因素做出快速、主观的决定。如果这个过程感觉过于混乱或情绪化，最好不要下订单，特别是像一对突破订单或反向订单这样复杂的订单。交易者不应该在一个混乱的交易中投入过多的情绪，因为他们很可能因此而错过随后可能出现的清晰交易机会。

>An inside bar after a swing move might mark the end of the swing, especially if its close is against the trend and other factors are in play, like a trend line or trend channel line overshoot, an ABC two-legged correction (a high or low 2), or a new swing high in a trading range. Also, any small bar, whether or not it is an inside bar, near an extreme of any large bar (trend bar, doji, or outside bar) can set up a reversal, especially if the small bar is a small reversal bar. In general, traders should be looking to buy low and sell high. In a trading range (a trading range day or a trading range in a trend day), the only small bar entries should be fades at the extremes. For example, if a small bar is a swing high, or follows a bear trend line test or a bull trend channel line overshoot and reversal, only look for a short entry. If it is a swing low, only look for a buy.

在摆动走势之后的内包k线可能标志着摆动走势的结束，特别是如果其收盘价与趋势相反，并且有其他因素在起作用，例如趋势线或趋势通道线的过度触及、ABC 两段式修正（高点或低点 2），或者交易区间内的新摆动高点。

此外，任何小实体k线，无论是否是内包k线，只要靠近任何大型 K 线（趋势 K 线、十字星或外部 K 线）的极端点，都可能形成反转，特别是如果这个小型K线是一个小的反转 K 线。

总的来说，交易者应该寻求低买高卖。在交易区间内（无论是交易区间日还是趋势日中的交易区间），唯一的小型K线入场机会应该是极端点的逆势交易。例如，如果一个小型K线是一个摆动高点，或者是在测试熊市趋势线或看涨趋势通道线过度触及并反转之后，则只寻找做空入场。如果它是一个摆动低点，则只寻找买入机会。

>In a trend (even one during a trading range day), a small bar can set up an entry in either direction. For example, if there is a strong bull move and no prior break of a significant bull trend line, an inside bar near the high of a large bull trend bar or a small bar that extends above the high of the trend bar should only be viewed as a buy setup. If it is an inside bar,especially if it is a bull trend bar, it is a great long setup. If it is simply a small bar that extends above the high of the bull trend bar,  it might be a safe long setup if the trend is strong enough.In general, it would be better to wait for a pullback, unless the small bar is a bear reversal bar,in which case it could trap bears and it might make sense to buy on a stop at one tick above its high.

在趋势中（即使是在交易区间日内的趋势），一个小型K线可以形成任一方向的交易机会。

例如，如果有一个强劲的看涨走势，并且之前没有突破重要的看涨趋势线，那么一个靠近大型看涨趋势 K 线高点的内包k线，或者一个延伸至趋势 K 线高点上方的小型K线，都应该只被视为一个买入交易机会。如果它是一个内包k线，特别是如果它是一个看涨趋势 K 线，那它是一个极好的做多交易机会。如果它仅仅是一个延伸至看涨趋势 K 线高点上方的小型K线，如果趋势足够强劲，它可能是一个安全的做多交易机会。

总的来说，最好等待回调，除非这个小型K线是一个看跌反转 K 线，在这种情况下，它可能会困住空头，并且在它高点上方一个跳动点处设置止损买入可能是有意义的。

>An ii pattern is an inside bar that follows a larger inside bar. It is two in a row with the second being inside the first and of the same size or smaller (an iii is even stronger, with three in a row). After a protracted move, especially if there has been a trend line break, a with-trend breakout from an ii pattern is often just a scalp and has a good chance of reversing before or after the profit target is reached (a final flag, as described in book 3). However, a countertrend breakout (or a reversal from a final flag) often leads to a large reversal. The pattern often develops in a final flag because it finally indicates balance between the bulls and the bears;the strength of the weaker side has caught up to that of the stronger side, at least temporarily.As such, if the with-trend side takes control, the odds are high that the countertrend side will try to take it back after the with-trend breakout. The stop on an ii pattern is beyond the opposite side of both bars (not just the second bar, which technically is the signal bar), but sometimes you can use a smaller stop (beyond the second of the two bars instead of beyond both bars) if the bars are relatively large. After the entry bar closes, tighten the stop and consider reversing at one tick beyond the entry bar. Keep looking to reverse on any failure in the next several bars since failures are common soon after ii breakouts, especially if the pattern forms in the middle of the day's range.

当一个内包k线（inside bar）出现在另一个更大的内包k线之后，就形成了 **ii 模式**。这意味着连续两根 K 线都是内包k线，第二根位于第一根内部，且大小相同或更小（**iii 模式** 甚至更强，有连续三根）。

在一段长时间的走势之后，特别是如果出现了趋势线突破，**顺应趋势的 ii 模式突破** 往往只是一个 **短线交易机会（scalp）**，很有可能在达到盈利目标之前或之后反转（如第三本书中描述的 **最终旗形**）。然而，**逆势突破（或最终旗形的反转）** 往往会带来 **大幅反转**。

这种模式经常在最终旗形中形成，因为它最终表明 **多头和空头之间达到了平衡**；较弱一方的力量至少暂时赶上了较强一方。因此，如果顺应趋势的一方掌控了局面，那么在顺应趋势突破之后，逆势一方很有可能会试图夺回控制权。

ii 模式的 **止损点** 应该设在 **两根 K 线（ii 模式中的两根）的反向一侧之外**（不仅仅是第二根 K 线，尽管技术上它是信号 K 线）。但如果 K 线相对较大，有时你可以使用 **更小的止损点**（在两根 K 线中的第二根之外，而不是两根 K 线之外）。

入场 K 线收盘后，**收紧止损** 并考虑在入场 K 线之外一个跳动点处 **反向操作**。在接下来的几根 K 线中，继续寻找任何失败的反向交易机会，因为 ii 模式突破后很快就会出现失败，特别是如果该模式在当天交易区间的中间形成。

>A 5 minute ii pattern is often a 1 minute double bottom pullback in a bull trend or a double top pullback in a bear trend (described in book 2), which are reversal patterns and might explain why a small ii can lead to a large countertrend move.

一个 5 分钟的 ii 模式通常是 **1 分钟的双底回调（在牛市趋势中）** 或 **双顶回调（在熊市趋势中）**（在第二本书中描述）。这些都是 **反转模式**，这可能解释了为什么一个小的 ii 模式可以导致大的 **逆势运动**。

>When there is a strong bull trend, there will sometimes be two consecutive bars with identical highs, and usually with small tails at the tops of the two bars. This is a two-bar double top buy setup and is a double top on the 1 minute chart. Place a stop to go long at one tick above the high of the bars because you will be buying a failed double top and there will be protective stops there from traders who shorted it, adding fuel to the move. Likewise, in a strong bear trend, look to short on a stop at one tick below a two-bar double bottom sell setup.

当出现强劲的牛市趋势时，有时会出现连续两根 K 线具有 **相同的高点**，并且通常在两根 K 线的顶部有 **小的影线**。这是一个 **两 K 线双顶买入交易机会**，在 1 分钟图表上它是一个双顶。

将止损买入订单放置在两根 K 线高点上方一个跳动点处，因为你将买入一个 **失败的双顶**，并且做空交易者的保护性止损也会在此处，为上涨提供动力。

同样地，在强劲的熊市趋势中，寻找在 **两 K 线双底卖出交易机会** 的低点下方一个跳动点处设置止损做空。

>Two-bar reversal setups go by several names, and each is an overlapping pair of trend bars with opposite directions and bodies of about the same size. In a two-bar reversal top setup,the first bar is a bull trend bar and the second is a bear trend bar, and this combination is a sell setup if the market is not in a trading range. A two-bar reversal bottom is a bear trend bar and then a bull trend bar and forms a buy setup.They are each basically a two-bar reversal pattern and they correspond to a 10 minute reversal bar (just imagine how the two 5 minute bars would look when combined into a single 10 minute bar).

两 K 线反转交易机会有几种不同的名称，每种都是一对 **重叠的趋势 K 线**，方向相反，实体大小大致相同。

在 **两 K 线反转顶部交易机会** 中，第一根 K 线是看涨趋势 K 线，第二根是看跌趋势 K 线，如果市场不在交易区间内，这种组合是一个 **卖出交易机会**。

**两 K 线反转底部** 是一个看跌趋势 K 线，然后是一个看涨趋势 K 线，形成一个 **买入交易机会**。

它们本质上都是两 K 线反转模式，并且它们对应于一个 10 分钟的反转 K 线（想象一下两根 5 分钟的 K 线组合成一根 10 分钟的 K 线会是什么样子）。

>A two-bar reversal can be a continuation pattern (a one-bar flag) or a reversal pattern,depending on the context. For example, if the market is in a strong bear spike and then has a bear bar and then a small bull trend bar with a low that is close to the low of the bar before it,this is a two-bar reversal. However, since the market is in a steep trend, you should never look to buy above it. Instead, you should view the bull bar as a one-bar bear flag and consider shorting below it. In contrast, if the identical two-bar pattern formed in a bull trend at the end of a two-legged pullback to the moving average, this is a two-bar reversal and a good setup for a buy setup. The pullback is ending and reversing back into the bull trend.

两 K 线反转可以是一个 **持续模式（单 K 线旗形）** 也可以是一个 **反转模式**，这取决于市场背景。

例如，如果市场处于强劲的熊市急跌中，然后出现一根看跌 K 线，紧接着是一根小的看涨趋势 K 线，其低点接近前一根 K 线的低点，这便是一个两 K 线反转。然而，由于市场正处于急剧的趋势中，你绝不应该在它上方寻找买入机会。相反，你应该将这根看涨 K 线视为 **单 K 线熊旗**，并考虑在其下方做空。

相反，如果相同的两 K 线模式出现在牛市趋势中，在两段式回调至移动平均线末端形成，那么这是一个 **两 K 线反转** 和一个很好的 **买入交易机会**。这表示回调正在结束并反转回牛市趋势。

>When a trend bar in a strong trend has a shaved body (no tail at one or both ends), it usually indicates that the market is one-sided and strong. However, a shaved top on a 5 minute bull trend bar in a runaway bull trend is stronger than a shaved bottom, because the extreme strength is right into the close of the bar and it is more likely to continue the strength that occurred five minutes earlier. Therefore, a shaved top is a good setup for a long. If the bar has a one-tick tail at its high or a shaved bottom, it is still strong, but in general that alone would not be reason enough to buy above its high. Also, the bar has to be analyzed in context. If the bar is in a trading range, it would be foolish to buy above its high, because trading ranges tend to test the extremes repeatedly and you should not be buying near the high when the odds of the bar being a test are greater than the odds of the bar being a successful breakout. Similarly,a bear trend bar with a shaved bottom in a runaway bear trend is a setup to short at one tick below its low.

当一个强劲趋势中的趋势 K 线是 **“光头光脚”K 线**（在某一个或两个末端没有影线）时，通常表示市场呈 **单边走势且强势**。

然而，在失控的牛市趋势中，5 分钟看涨趋势 K 线的 **“光头”**（顶部没有影线）比“光脚”（底部没有影线）更强劲，因为这种极端的力量一直持续到 K 线收盘，更有可能延续五分钟前的强势。因此，**“光头”K 线是一个很好的做多交易机会**。

如果 K 线高点带有一点点影线或底部是“光脚”的，它仍然很强，但通常仅凭这一点不足以成为在其高点上方买入的理由。此外，K 线必须结合市场背景进行分析。如果 K 线处于交易区间内，在其高点上方买入是愚蠢的，因为交易区间倾向于反复测试极端点，当该 K 线作为测试而非成功突破的可能性更大时，你不应该在高点附近买入。

同样地，在失控的熊市趋势中，一个底部“光脚”的看跌趋势 K 线是 **在其低点下方一个跳动点做空的交易机会**。

>When the market is quiet and the volume is low, shaved tops and bottoms are sometimes common and are not a sign of strength. When you see many shaved tops and bottoms in an hour or so and they are in a trading range, be very selective about trading. Each of those bars is a trap, fooling traders into believing that there is strength when there is none.

当市场平静且成交量较低时，**光头光脚 K 线** 有时很常见，但它们并非强度的标志。

如果你在一个小时左右的时间内看到许多光头光脚 K 线，并且它们出现在一个交易区间内，那么在交易时要 **非常谨慎**。这些 K 线中的每一个都是一个陷阱，诱骗交易者相信市场有强度，而实际上并没有。

>Not all small bars are good fade setups. There is one particular situation where they should not be used as signal bars, and that is when the bar is a small doji (small relative to the recent bars), especially if it has no body, it is near the moving average, and it occurs approximately between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. PST. These have a very high failure rate and always require more price action before placing a trade.

并非所有小型K线都是好的逆势交易机会。有一种特定情况，它们不应该被用作信号 K 线，那就是当 K 线是一个 **小的十字星（相对于近期 K 线而言较小）**，特别是如果它 **没有实体、靠近移动平均线，并且大约发生在太平洋时间上午 10:00 到上午 11:00 之间**。这些 K 线的失败率非常高，在进行交易之前总是需要更多的价格行为确认。

>Although most large trend bars that are with trend are strong, if a bar is unusually large, it often represents a climactic exhaustion (a buy climax). For example, in a bull trend, it often means that the last buyers bought and they bought in a panic because they just had to get in at any price, or if they were short, they just had to buy back their losing shorts at any price. If there are no more buyers, the market will go down. Any standard reversal setup can serve as a signal bar, but a second entry with a strong reversal bar is always the safest setup when trading countertrend.

尽管大多数顺应趋势的大型趋势 K 线都表现强劲，但如果一个 K 线异常巨大，它通常代表着 **高潮式衰竭（买入高潮）**。

例如，在牛市趋势中，这通常意味着最后一批买家已经入场，他们恐慌性买入，不惜任何价格也要进场；或者如果是做空者，他们不惜任何价格也要平仓止损。如果没有更多的买家，市场就会下跌。

任何标准的 **反转交易机会** 都可以作为信号 K 线，但当进行逆势交易时，**带有强劲反转 K 线的二次入场** 始终是最安全的交易机会。

>Big trend bars on breakouts often fail on the next bar, trapping traders into the wrong side of the market. This is especially common on quiet trading range days, when the market is always surging to the top and bottom of the range and fooling naive traders into expecting a successful breakout.

突破时出现的 **大型趋势 K 线** 经常在下一根 K 线时失败，将交易者困在市场的错误一边。

这种情况在 **平静的交易区间日** 中尤为常见，此时市场总是在区间的顶部和底部波动，欺骗那些天真的交易者，让他们期望出现成功的突破。

>A small bar can be a with-trend or countertrend setup. In a trend, a small bar on a pullback is only a with-trend setup. As shown in Figure 6.1, bars 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, and 21 were small bars in pullbacks and the only trade they offered was a short on a stop at one tick below their lows.Even though they were mostly doji bars, they were with trend and therefore reasonable shorts. Most signal bars in a strong trend look weak, and that is one of the reasons why the trend just keeps working lower. Bears are eager to short and bulls want to exit with a smaller loss, and both keep waiting for a strong sell setup. This would make them confident that the market is not going to rally and that they need to get out immediately. The perfect setup never comes, and the bears are trapped out and the bulls are trapped in. This creates a constant sense of tension and urgency that keeps driving the market down. Both keep selling in small pieces all day long, just in case their perfect setup never comes... and it usually doesn't. The setups never look strong, so it is easy for traders to assume that the trend is weak and that there will soon be a good rally that will allow them to sell at a better price. They see the market staying below the moving average, but it never falls fast enough to make them panic,so they keep hoping for a bigger rally to sell. The weak signal bars are an important ingredient in strong trends.

一个小型K线既可以是顺应趋势的交易机会，也可以是逆势交易机会。在趋势中，**回调中的小型K线只是一种顺应趋势的交易机会**。

如图 6.1 所示，第 7、9、12、14、17 和 21 号 K 线是回调中的小型K线，它们唯一提供的交易机会是在其低点下方一个跳动点处设置止损做空。尽管它们大多是十字星，但它们顺应趋势，因此是合理的做空机会。

---

##### 强势趋势中的“弱信号 K 线”

在强劲的趋势中，大多数信号 K 线看起来都很弱，这也是趋势持续走低的原因之一。空头渴望做空，而多头希望以较小的损失离场，双方都在等待一个强劲的卖出交易机会。这会让他们确信市场不会反弹，需要立即离场。

然而，**完美的交易机会从不出现**，空头被困在场外，多头被困在场内。这造成了一种持续的紧张感和紧迫感，不断推动市场下跌。双方全天都在小批量卖出，以防他们完美的交易机会永远不会出现……而它通常也确实不会出现。

---

##### 交易者的心理误区

交易机会看起来从不强劲，因此交易者很容易认为趋势疲软，并且很快就会出现一次好的反弹，这将使他们能够以更好的价格卖出。他们看到市场保持在移动平均线下方，但它从未快速下跌到让他们恐慌的程度，所以他们一直希望有更大的反弹来卖出。

因此，**弱信号 K 线是强劲趋势中的重要组成部分**。

>A small bar can also set up a countertrend trade against a trend if it occurs at a swing low and there are other reasons for trading countertrend, like a prior trend line break. Bar 16 was a small bear bar that set up a long after a break above

一个小型K线也可以在趋势中形成逆势交易机会，如果它出现在 **摆动低点**，并且有其他进行逆势交易的理由，比如 **之前的趋势线突破**。例如，第 16 号 K 线是一个小的看跌 K 线，它在突破上方后形成了一个做多交易机会。

>the bear trend line and the high 4 bottom of the bear channel from bars 7 to 13. There was a two-legged pullback from the bar 14 test of the moving average, and the market was likely to have a second leg up.

第 16 号 K 线是一个小的看跌 K 线，它在突破熊市趋势线和从第 7 到第 13 号 K 线的熊市通道的 **高 4 底部** 之后，形成了一个做多交易机会。

从第 14 号 K 线测试移动平均线后，市场出现了 **两段式回调**，很可能会有第二波上涨。

>The only time that a trader should sell a small bar at a low is in a bear trend, and preferably during a strong bear spike. Bar 29 was not particularly small, but it was an inside bar, which functions like a small bar, and it was a bear trend bar, making it a safe short at the low of the day.

交易者唯一应该在低点卖出**小k线** 的情况是处于熊市趋势中，并且最好是在强劲的熊市急跌期间。

第 29 号 K 线虽然不是特别小，但它是一个内包k线，其功能类似于**小k线**，而且它是一个看跌趋势 K 线，这使得在当天低点进行做空是一个安全的交易机会。

>Bar 13 was the middle bar of a three-bar reversal up, and bar 17 was the middle of a four-bar reversal down. All multiple bar reversals are just variations of two-bar reversals. There were several other reversals on the chart, as there are on all charts.

第 13 号 K 线是 **三 K 线反转向上** 的中间 K 线，而第 17 号 K 线是 **四 K 线反转向下** 的中间 K 线。

所有多 K 线反转都只是两 K 线反转的变体。图表上还有其他几次反转，就像所有图表上都会有反转一样。
