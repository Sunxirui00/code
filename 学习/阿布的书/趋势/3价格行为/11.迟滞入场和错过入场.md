>If you look at any chart and think that if you had taken the original entry you would still be holding the swing portion of your trade, then you need to enter at the market. The market has a clear always-in position, and you need to participate in the trend, because the probability of making a profit is high. However, you should enter only with the number of shares or contracts that you would still be holding had you taken the original entry, and you should use the same trailing stop. Your stop will usually be larger than what you would use for a scalp,and you therefore need to trade a smaller position to keep your dollar risk the same. For example, if you see a strong trend underway in GS, and had you taken the original entry with 300 shares you now would only be holding 100 shares with your protective stop $1.50 away,you should buy 100 shares at the market and place a $1.50 protective stop. Logically, it doesn't make any difference whether you are buying a swing-size portion now or holding a swing position from an earlier entry. Although it might be easier emotionally to think of the trade with the open profit as risking someone else's money, that is not the reality. It is yourmoney, and what you are risking is no different from buying now and risking the same $1.50.Traders know this and will place the trade without hesitation. If they do not, then they simply do not believe that they would still be holding any shares had they entered earlier, or they need to work on this emotional issue.

如果你看任何图表，并认为如果你当初进行了最初的入场，现在仍然会持有你的波段交易部分，那么你现在就需要 **市价入场**。市场有一个明确的“永远在场（always-in）”的仓位，你需要参与到趋势中，因为盈利的概率很高。

##### 迟滞入场的仓位管理
#策略 #仓位  #入场
然而，你应该只用你如果当初进行最初入场时现在仍会持有的股票或合约数量来入场，并且你应该使用相同的追踪止损。你的止损通常会比你用于短线交易的止损要大，因此你需要交易较小的仓位，以保持你的风险金额不变。

例如，如果你看到 GS（高盛）有一个强劲的趋势正在进行中，而如果你当初以 300 股入场，现在你只会持有 100 股，保护性止损距离为 $1.50，那么你应该在市价买入 100 股，并设置 $1.50 的保护性止损。

##### 交易心理与风险认知
#心法
从逻辑上讲，你现在买入波段大小的部分，还是从早先的入场点持有波段仓位，并没有任何区别。尽管在情感上，将带有浮动盈利的交易视为冒“别人的钱”的风险可能更容易接受，但这并非现实。那是 **你的钱**，你所冒的风险与现在买入并承担同样的 $1.50 风险没有任何不同。

聪明的交易者明白这一点，并会毫不犹豫地下单。如果他们不这样做，那么他们根本不相信如果他们早些入场现在还会持有任何股票，或者他们需要解决这个情绪问题。

>Once the market starts forming four or more consecutive bull trend bars that are not too large and therefore possibly climactic, traders should buy at least a small position at the market instead of waiting for a pullback.

#信号 #入场 
一旦市场开始形成四根或更多连续的看涨趋势 K 线，且这些 K 线不太大，因此可能预示着高潮（climactic）时，交易者应该**市价买入至少一个小仓位**，而不是等待回调。

>As shown in Figure 11.1, GS had a strong two-legged sell-off into the close yesterday but a strong bull reversal bar at bar 2. It was setting up a higher low test of the bear low and a bull trend day.

如在图 11.1 中所示，昨日 GS 在收盘时经历了强劲的两波抛售，但在 K 线 2 形成了一个强劲的看涨反转 K 线。这预示着对熊市低点的更高低点测试以及一个看涨趋势日。

>If traders began watching this chart at around bar 4, they would have seen a series of bull trend bars and a strong bull trend. They would probably have wished that they had at least the swing portion of their position still working. If they normally trade 300 shares and at this point would have only 100 shares left from that entry above bar 3, they should buy 100 shares at the market. Also, they should use the same stop that they would have used had they entered above bar 3. Since they would have only the swing portion remaining, they should use a breakeven stop or maybe risk about 10 cents below the bar 3 high. They should also look for pauses and pullbacks to add on. After adding on above bar 6, they could move the stop for the entire position to one tick below the bar 6 signal bar and then trail it up.

##### 盘中入场策略

如果交易者大约在 K 线 4 左右开始观察这张图表，他们会看到一系列看涨趋势 K 线和一个强劲的看涨趋势。他们可能会希望自己至少仍持有部分波段交易仓位。

#策略 #仓位 #管理 
如果他们通常交易 300 股，并且此时从 K 线 3 上方入场后只剩下 100 股，那么他们应该在**市价买入 100 股**。此外，他们应该使用与当初在 K 线 3 上方入场时相同的止损。由于他们只会保留波段部分，他们应该使用**盈亏平衡止损**，或者可能只承担 K 线 3 高点下方约 10 美分的风险。他们还应该寻找**暂停和回调来加仓**。在 K 线 6 上方加仓后，他们可以将整个仓位的止损移动到 K 线 6 信号 K 线下方一个跳动点，然后向上追踪止损。

>Entering late while using the original stop is absolutely identical to being long the swing portion of the original position, using the same protective stop.

##### 晚期入场与原始仓位的等效性
#管理 
**在后期入场并使用原始止损，与持有原始仓位的波段部分，并使用相同的保护性止损是完全相同的**。

*不论何时入场，都应该设置同样的止损位*
