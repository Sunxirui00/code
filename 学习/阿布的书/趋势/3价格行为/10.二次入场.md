>Analysts often say that bottoms on the daily chart usually require a second reversal off the low to convince enough traders to trade the market as a possible new bull trend. However, this is true of tops as well. A second entry is almost always more likely to result in a profitable trade than a first entry.

分析师常说，日线图上的底部通常需要**第二次从低点反转**，才能说服足够多的交易者将市场视为可能的新牛市趋势。然而，这种情况对顶部同样适用。

**二次入场**几乎总是比首次入场更有可能带来盈利的交易。

>If the second entry is letting you in at a better price than the first, be suspicious that it might be a trap. Most good second entries are at the same price or worse. A second-entry trader is someone entering late, trying to minimize risk, and the market usually makes him pay a little more for that additional information. If it is charging you less, it might be setting you up to steal your money in a failed signal.

如果第二次入场让你以比第一次更好的价格进场，那么请警惕，这可能是一个陷阱。

##### 警惕“便宜”的二次入场

大多数好的二次入场，其价格都与第一次入场相同或更差。**二次入场交易者**是那些迟入场、试图将风险最小化的人，而市场通常会让他们为这些额外的市场信息支付更高的代价。

如果市场让你支付更少，它可能是在设局，试图通过一个失败的信号来“偷走”你的钱。

>Traders looking for second entries are more aggressive and confident and will often enter on smaller time frame charts. This usually results in traders on the 5 minute charts entering after many other traders have already entered, making the entry a little worse. If the market is letting you in at a better price, you should suspect that you are missing something and should consider not taking the trade. Most of the time, a good fill equals a bad trade (and a bad fill equals a good trade!).

寻找二次入场的交易者通常更激进、更自信，并且经常会在较小时间周期的图表上入场。这通常会导致 5 分钟图表上的交易者在许多其他交易者已经入场后才入场，使得入场价格稍差。

如果市场让你以更好的价格入场，你应该怀疑自己是不是错过了什么，并考虑不要进行这笔交易。

##### 交易中的“反直觉”现象

大多数时候，**好的成交价（即比预期更优的入场价）等于一次糟糕的交易**（而糟糕的成交价，即比预期更差的入场价，反而等于一次好的交易！）。

>If you are fading a move, for example shorting the first reversal in a strong bull trend where the move had about four consecutive bull trend bars or two or three large bull trend bars,there is too much momentum for you to be placing an order in the opposite direction. It is better to wait for an entry, not take it, wait for the trend to resume for a bar or two, and then enter on the market's second attempt to reverse.

如果你正在对一个走势进行逆势交易，例如在一个强劲的牛市趋势中做空第一次反转，而该走势已经出现大约四根连续的看涨趋势 K 线或两到三根大型看涨趋势 K 线，那么**动能太强，不适合你立即在相反方向下单**。

---
##### 逆势交易的更优策略
更好的做法是：
1. **等待一个入场机会。**
2. **放弃这个入场机会。**
3. **等待趋势恢复一到两根 K 线。**
4. 然后，在市场第二次尝试反转时再入场。

>There were many second-entry trades today (see Figure 10.1), and all but one were at the same price or a worse price than the first entry. Look at the bar 10 long. The market is letting you buy at one tick better than the traders who bought at bar 9. In general, the "good fill, bad trade" maxim applies. Whenever the market is offering you a bargain, assume that you are reading the chart incorrectly; usually it is better not to take the trade. Even though bar 10 was a second entry, the momentum down was strong, as seen by the tight bear channel down from bar 8. Before taking a countertrend trade, it is always better to see some evidence in the preceding several bars that the bulls were able to move more than just a couple of ticks above the prior bar.As discussed in book 3, most tops occur from some type of micro double top, like bar 1 and the bear reversal bar from two bars earlier, and most bottoms occur from some type of micro double bottom, like bar 18 and the bar before bar 17.

今天有很多二次入场交易机会（见图 10.1），除了一个以外，所有二次入场价格都与首次入场相同或更差。

##### K 线 10 的做多机会：警惕“好成交价，坏交易”

看看 K 线 10 的做多机会。市场让你以比在 K 线 9 买入的交易者好一个跳动点的价格买入。通常，这里适用“**好成交价，坏交易**”的格言。

每当市场给你提供一个“便宜货”时，请假设你正在错误地解读图表；通常最好不要进行这笔交易。尽管 K 线 10 是一个二次入场，但向下的动能很强劲，这可以从 K 线 8 开始的紧密熊市通道中看出。

---
##### 逆势交易前的观察

在进行逆势交易之前，最好总能从前几根 K 线中看到一些证据，表明多头能够将价格推高超过前一根 K 线几个跳动点。

---
##### 顶部和底部的形态

正如在书 3 中讨论过的，大多数顶部都发生在某种微型双顶（micro double top）之后，例如 K 线 1 和两根 K 线之前的看跌反转 K 线。而大多数底部都发生在某种微型双底（micro double bottom）之后，例如 K 线 18 和 K 线 17 之前的那根 K 线。

>When the momentum is strong, it is better to wait for a second reversal setup before trading countertrend (see Figure 10.2).Bar 1 followed five bull trend bars, which is too much upward momentum to be shorting the first attempt down. 
>Smart traders would wait to see it the bulls would fail in a second attempt to rally before going short, and this happened on the second short entry at bar 2.
>Bar 3 was a first entry long on a new low of the day, but after six bars without a bullish close it makes more sense to wait for a second long entry, which occurred on bar 4.
>Bar 5 followed four bear trend bars, which is too much downward momentum to buy. A second entry never developed, so smart traders averted a loss by waiting.
>Bar 10 followed six bars with higher lows and only two bars with small bear bodies, indicating too much bullish strength for a short. There was a second entry at the bar 11 bear reversal bar.

当动能强劲时，最好等待第二次反转交易机会出现后再进行逆势交易（见图 10.2）。

##### 案例分析：动能与二次入场

- **K 线 1：** 紧随五根看涨趋势 K 线之后，上涨动能过强，不适合在第一次下跌尝试时做空。聪明的交易者会等待观察多头在第二次反弹尝试中是否会失败，然后才做空，这种情况发生在 **K 线 2 的第二次做空入场**。
- **K 线 3：** 是当日新低处的首次做多入场，但在连续六根 K 线没有看涨收盘后，等待第二次做多入场更有意义，这发生在 **K 线 4**。
- **K 线 5：** 紧随四根看跌趋势 K 线之后，下跌动能过强，不适合买入。第二次入场机会从未出现，因此聪明的交易者通过等待避免了损失。
- **K 线 10：** 紧随六根更高低点的 K 线之后，且只有两根小实体看跌 K 线，这表明看涨力量过强，不适合做空。在 **K 线 11 的看跌反转 K 线** 处出现了第二次入场机会。
