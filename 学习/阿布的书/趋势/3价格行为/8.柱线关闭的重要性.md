>A 5 minute bar usually assumes something similar to its final appearance seconds to a minute or more before the bar closes. If you enter before the bar closes, you might occasionally make a tick or so more on your trade. However, once or twice every day, the signal that you thought was going to happen does not and you will lose about eight ticks. That means that you need about eight early entries to work as planned for every one that does not, and that simply won't happen. You can enter early with trend in a strong trend and you will likely be fine.However, when there is a strong trend, you have so much confidence in the signal that there is no downside to waiting for the bar to close and then entering on a stop beyond the bar. You cannot be deciding on every bar if an early entry is appropriate, because you have too many other important decisions to make. If you add that to you list of things to think about, you will likely end up missing many good trades every day and forgo far more in missed opportunitiesthan you could gain on an occasional successful early entry.

一根 5 分钟 K 线通常在收盘前几秒到一分钟或更长时间内，其形态就已经大致确定了。如果你在 K 线收盘前入场，有时你的交易可能会多赚一两个跳动点。

---

##### 提前入场的风险

然而，每天总有一两次，你以为会发生的信号并没有实现，你将损失大约八个跳动点。这意味着你需要大约八次按计划成功的提前入场，才能弥补一次失败的损失，这根本不可能发生。

在强劲的趋势中，你可以顺应趋势提前入场，而且很可能没问题。但是，当趋势强劲时，你对信号非常有信心，等待 K 线收盘再在 K 线之外设置止损入场，没有任何坏处。

---

##### 避免过度思考

你不能在每根 K 线上都决定是否适合提前入场，因为你还有太多其他重要的决定要做。如果你把这个也加入到你的思考清单中，你很可能会每天错过许多好的交易，并且因错失机会而放弃的收益，将远远超过你偶尔成功提前入场所能获得的收益。

>This holds true for all time frames. For example, look at a daily chart and you will see many bars that opened near the low but closed in the middle. Each one of those bars was a strong bull trend bar with a last price on the high at some point during the day. If you bought under the assumption that the bar was going to close on its high and bought near the high and instead it closed in the middle, you would realize your mistake. You are carrying home a trade that you never would have entered at the end of the day.

这种观察适用于所有时间周期。例如，如果你查看日线图，你会看到许多 K 线开盘价接近最低点，但收盘价却在中间位置。

---
##### 盘中变化与交易决策

这些 K 线中的每一根，在盘中某个时候都曾是强劲的看涨趋势 K 线，收盘价接近最高点。如果你在认为 K 线将收于最高点的假设下，在接近高点的位置买入，但它最终却收在了中间，你就会意识到自己的错误。这样一来，你持有的一个交易，是你本来在一天结束时绝不会入场的。

>There are two common problems that regularly occur on the 5 minute chart. The most costly is when you try to pick a bottom in a strong trend. Typically you will see a lower low after a trend line break and traders will be hoping for a strong reversal bar, especially if there is also a bear trend channel line overshoot. The bar sets up nicely and is a strong bull reversal bar by the third minute or so. The price is hanging near the high of the bar for a couple of minutes, attracting more and more countertrend traders who want to get in early so that their risk will be smaller (their stop will be below the bar), but then with one to five seconds remaining before the bar closes, the price collapses and the bar closes on its low. All of those early longs who were trying to risk a tick or two less end up losing two points or more. These longs let themselves get trapped into a bad trade. A similar situation happens many times a day when a potential signal bar is forming just before the bar closes. For example, a trader might be looking to short below a bear reversal bar that has seconds to go before it closes, and the current price is on the bottom of the bar. With less than a second before the bar closes, the close bounces up two or three ticks from the low of the bar, and the bar closes off its low. The market is telling the trader that the signal is now weaker, and the trader needs to avoid getting trapped into trading based on the expectation and hope that she had just three seconds ago.

在 5 分钟图表上经常出现两个常见问题。

---

##### 1. 在强劲趋势中抄底的代价

最常见的损失是当你试图在一个强劲的趋势中抄底时。通常你会看到趋势线突破后出现一个更低的低点，交易者会希望出现一个强劲的看涨反转 K 线，特别是如果还有熊市趋势通道线超调的情况。

这个 K 线在第三分钟左右看起来非常完美，是一个强劲的看涨反转 K 线。价格在 K 线高点附近徘徊了几分钟，吸引了越来越多的逆势交易者，他们希望提早入场以减小风险（他们的止损会设在该 K 线下方）。但随后，在 K 线收盘前的一到五秒内，价格突然崩溃，K 线收于其最低点。所有那些试图少冒一两个跳动点风险的提早做多者，最终都损失了两个点或更多。这些做多者让自己陷入了一笔糟糕的交易。

---

##### 2. 信号 K 线在收盘前的突然变化

类似的情况每天都会发生很多次，当一个潜在的信号 K 线在收盘前正在形成时。例如，一个交易者可能正准备在一个看跌反转 K 线的下方做空，该 K 线离收盘只剩下几秒钟，当前价格位于 K 线的底部。然而，在 K 线收盘前不到一秒钟，收盘价从 K 线的最低点向上反弹两到三个跳动点，K 线收盘价偏离了最低点。市场正在告诉交易者，信号现在变弱了，交易者需要避免被三秒钟前所抱有的预期和希望所困扰。

>The other common problem is getting trapped out of a good trade. For example, if you just bought and your trade has had three to five ticks of open profit but the market just can't hit six, allowing you to scalp out with four ticks of profit, you start to become nervous. You look at the 3 or 5 minute chart with about 10 seconds before its bar closes and it is a strong bear reversal bar. You then move your protective stop up to one tick below that bar, and just before the bar closes, the market drops and hits your stop, only to pop up several ticks in the final two seconds of the bar. Then, within the first 30 seconds of the next bar, the market quickly goes up to six ticks where smart traders took partial profits while you are sitting on the sidelines. Good entry, good plan, bad discipline. You just let yourself get trapped out of a good trade. If you had followed your plan and relied on your initial stop until the entry bar closed,you would have secured your profit.

另一个常见问题是：**被困出（trapped out）一个好交易**。

---

##### 被困出的场景示例

例如，如果你刚刚买入，并且你的交易已经有三到五个跳动点的浮动盈利，但市场就是无法达到六个跳动点，让你无法以四个跳动点的盈利短线离场，你就会开始紧张。你查看 3 或 5 分钟图表，在 K 线收盘前大约 10 秒，它是一个强劲的看跌反转 K 线。

你于是将你的保护性止损上移到该 K 线下方一个跳动点。就在 K 线收盘前，市场下跌并触及你的止损，结果在 K 线的最后两秒又突然上涨了几个跳动点。然后，在下一根 K 线的前 30 秒内，市场迅速上涨到六个跳动点，聪明的交易者在那里部分获利了结，而你却只能坐壁上观。

---

##### 问题症结：纪律性

这是一个 **好的入场、好的计划，却因糟糕的纪律性** 导致的失误。你就是让自己被困出了一个好交易。如果你按照你的计划，并且在入场 K 线收盘之前一直依赖你最初的止损，你本可以保住你的利润。

>There is one other point about bar closes. Pay very close attention to the close of every bar,especially for the entry bar and the bar or two later. If the entry bar is six ticks tall, you would much prefer seeing the body suddenly increase from a body that was two ticks to one that was four ticks in the final seconds of the bar. You will then likely reduce the number of contracts that you will scalp out. This is true for the next couple of bars as well. If there are strong closes, you should be more willing to swing more contracts and hold them for more points than if these bars had weak closes.

关于 K 线收盘，还有一点需要非常注意：**密切关注每根 K 线的收盘情况**，特别是入场 K 线以及之后的一两根 K 线。

---

##### K 线收盘价的重要性

如果入场 K 线有六个跳动点高，你更希望看到在 K 线收盘前的最后几秒，实体部分突然从两个跳动点增加到四个跳动点。这样你可能会减少短线平仓的合约数量。

对于接下来的几根 K 线也是如此。如果它们有**强劲的收盘**，你应该更愿意持有更多合约并**进行波段操作（swing）** 以赚取更多点数，而不是这些 K 线收盘疲软的情况。

>Another reason why the close is important is that many institutional traders place orders based on value and not price action, and when they look at charts, the charts are line charts,which are based on the close. They would not look at charts at all if the charts did not influence their decision making, and the only price they are considering is the close, which increases its importance.

K 线收盘价之所以重要，还有一个原因：许多机构交易者是**根据价值而非价格行为来下订单的**。

---

##### 机构交易者的视角

当他们查看图表时，这些图表通常是 **基于收盘价的折线图**。如果图表不影响他们的决策，他们根本不会去看图表，而他们唯一考虑的价格就是收盘价，这进一步提升了收盘价的重要性。

>Smaller time frame charts allow for smaller stops but have a greater risk of stopping a trader out of a good trade. In Figure 8.1, the insert on the left shows that traders using the 3 minute chart were stopped out, but traders who relied on the 5 minute chart did not get stopped out.

较小时间周期的图表允许设置更小的止损，但却有更高的风险将交易者从一笔好交易中震出。

---

##### 图表周期的选择与止损

在图 8.1 中，左侧的插图显示，使用 3 分钟图表的交易者被止损出局，但那些依赖 5 分钟图表的交易者却没有被止损。

>The 5 minute Emini had been in a strong bear trend for weeks and was now starting to have bigger pullbacks. Each new lower low was being bought, and the longs were profitable countertrend trades. The bulls were more confident and the bears were becoming more willing to take profits. The thumbnail on the left is a 3 minute chart and the one on the right is a close-up of the 5 minute chart.

5 分钟 Emini 在过去几周一直处于强劲的熊市趋势中，现在开始出现更大的回调。每一个新的更低低点都被买入，多头在逆势交易中获利。多头变得更加自信，而空头则越来越愿意获利了结。

---
##### 图表视图说明

左侧的缩略图是 3 分钟图表，右侧的缩略图是 5 分钟图表的特写。

>Bar 11 was a strong bull reversal bar and a two-bar reversal, and it was the second attempt to reverse up from a lower low (the ii after bar 10 was the first) and it was the third push down on the day (a possible wedge bottom). This was a high-probability long, but the stop would have had to be beneath its low, three points below the entry price. This was more than what was typically required in the Emini (two points worked recently and when the average daily range had been about 10 to 15 points), but that was what the price action showed was needed. Iftraders were nervous, they could have just traded half size, but they must take a strong setup like this one and plan on swinging half.

K 线 11 是一个强劲的看涨反转 K 线，也是一个 **两 K 线反转**。这是第二次尝试从更低的低点反转上涨（K 线 10 之后的 ii 模式是第一次），而且是当天第三次下跌（可能形成一个楔形底部）。

---

##### 高概率做多机会与止损考量

这是一个高概率的做多交易机会，但止损必须设在其低点下方，也就是入场价格下方三个点。这超出了 Emini 中通常所需的止损范围（最近在日均波动范围约为 10 到 15 点时，两个点就足够了），但这是价格行为所显示的必要止损。

如果交易者感到紧张，他们可以只交易半仓，但他们必须抓住像这样强劲的交易机会，并计划进行半仓的波段操作。

>This is a perfect example of a common problem that traders face when they try to reduce risk by watching a smaller time frame chart. The risk is smaller but the probability of success also drops. Since there are more trades on a 3 minute chart, there is more risk of missing the best ones, and this can lead to the overall profitability of 3 minute trades being less for many traders.

这是一个完美的例子，说明了交易者在试图通过观察较小时间周期的图表来降低风险时，经常面临的共同问题。

---

##### 风险与成功率的权衡

虽然风险可能更小，但 **成功的概率也会下降**。由于 3 分钟图表上的交易机会更多，错过最佳交易机会的风险也更大，这可能导致许多交易者 3 分钟交易的整体盈利能力更低。

>Just like on the 5 minute chart, the 3 minute chart also had a reversal bar at bar 11. However,the stop below the entry bar was hit by a bear trend bar with a shaved top and bottom,indicating strong sellers. At this point, it would have been very difficult to reconcile that with the 5 minute chart where the stop had not been hit. The large size of the stop required on the 5 minute chart would make traders more willing to exit early and take a loss. If traders were also watching the 3 minute chart, they almost certainly would have exited with a loss and would have been trapped out of the market by that strong bear trend bar. The next bar on the 3 minute chart was a very strong outside bull trend bar, indicating that the bulls were violently asserting themselves in creating a higher low, but most of the weak hands who were stopped out would likely be so scared that they would not take the entry, and instead wait for a pullback.

就像 5 分钟图表一样，3 分钟图表在 K 线 11 也出现了一个反转 K 线。然而，入场 K 线下方的止损被一根 **顶部和底部光头光脚的看跌趋势 K 线** 触发了，这表明卖方力量强劲。

---

##### 多周期图表的冲突与交易者的困境

此时，这与 5 分钟图表（止损未被触发）的情况很难协调一致。5 分钟图表所需的较大止损会让交易者更愿意提前离场并承担损失。如果交易者同时也在观察 3 分钟图表，他们几乎肯定会止损离场，并被那根强劲的看跌趋势 K 线困在市场之外。

---

##### 错过反弹的“弱手”

3 分钟图表上的下一根 K 线是一个非常强劲的**外包看涨趋势 K 线**，表明多头正在强烈地确立自己，创造一个更高的低点。但大多数被止损出局的“弱手”可能因为过于恐惧而不敢入场，而是选择等待回调。

>Stop runs on the 3 minute chart are much more common than on the 5 minute chart at important reversals, and smart traders look at them as great opportunities. This is because they trap weak longs out of the market, forcing them to chase the market up. It is always better to just watch and trade off one chart because sometimes things happen too quickly for traders to think fast enough to place their orders if they are watching two charts and trying to reconcile the inconsistencies.

在重要的反转点，3 分钟图表上的**止损清盘（stop runs）** 比 5 分钟图表上要常见得多，而聪明的交易者会将它们视为绝佳的交易机会。这是因为它们将市场中的“弱手”多头震出，迫使他们追涨。

---

##### 专注单一图表的重要性

只观察一个图表进行交易总是更好的选择，因为有时市场变化太快，如果交易者同时观察两个图表并试图协调它们之间的不一致性，他们可能无法足够快地思考并下订单。
