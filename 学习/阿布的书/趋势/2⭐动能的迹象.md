>SIGNS OF STRENGTH: TRENDS, BREAKOUTS, REVERSAL BARS, AND REVERSALS
>强势信号：趋势、突破、反转K线和反转

>Here are some characteristics that are commonly found in strong trends:
>
>• There is a big gap opening on the day.
>• There are trending highs and lows (swings).
>• Most of the bars are trend bars in the direction of the trend.
> There is very little overlap of the bodies of consecutive bars. For example, in a bull spike,many bars have lows that are at or just one tick below the closes of the prior bar. Some bars have lows that are at and not below the close of the prior bar, so traders trying to buy on a limit order at the close of the prior bar do not get their orders filled and they have to buy higher.
>There are bars with no tails or small tails in either direction, indicating urgency. For example, in a bull trend, if a bull trend bar opens on its low tick and trends up, traders were eager to buy it as soon as the prior bar closed. If it closes on or near its high tick, traders continued their strong buying in anticipation of new buyers entering right after the bar closes.They were willing to buy going into the close because they were afraid that if they waited for the bar to close, they might have to buy a tick or two  higher.
>Occasionally, there are gaps between the bodies (for example, the open of a bar might be above the close of the prior bar in a bull trend).
>A breakout gap appears in the form of a strong trend bar at the start of the trend.
>Measuring gaps occur where the breakout test does not overlap the breakout point. For example, the pullback from a bull breakout does not drop below the high of the bar where the breakout occurred.
>Micro measuring gaps appear where there is a strong trend bar and a gap between the bar before it and the bar after it. For example, if the low of the bar after a strong bull trend bar in a bull trend is at or above the high of the bar before the trend bar, this is a gap and a breakout test and a sign of strength.
>No big climaxes appear.
>Not many large bars appear (not even large trend bars). Often, the largest trend bars are countertrend, trapping traders into looking for countertrend trades and missing with-trend trades. The countertrend setups almost always look better than the with-trend setups.
>No significant trend channel line overshoots occur, and the minor ones result in only sideways corrections.
>There are sideways corrections after trend line breaks.
>Failed wedges and other failed reversals occur.
>There is a sequence of 20 moving average gap bars (20 or more consecutive bars that do not touch the moving average, discussed in book 2).
>Few if any profitable countertrend trades are found.
>There are small, infrequent, and mostly sideways pullbacks. For example, if the Emini'saverage range is 12 points, the pullbacks will all likely be less than three or four points, and the market will often go for five or more bars without a pullback.
>There is a sense of urgency. You find yourself waiting through countless bars for a good with-trend pullback and one never comes, yet the market slowly continues to trend.
>The pullbacks have strong setups. For example, the high 1 and high 2 pullbacks in a bull trend have strong bull reversal bars for signal bars.
>In the strongest trends, the pullbacks usually have weak signal bars, making many traders not take them, and forcing traders to chase the market. For example, in a bear trend the signal bars for a low 2 short are often small bull bars in two or three bar bull spikes, and some of the entry bars are outside down bars. It has trending "anything": closes, highs, lows, or bodies.
>Repeated two-legged pullbacks are setting up with trend entries.
>No two consecutive trend bar closes occur on the opposite side of the moving average.
>The trend goes very far and breaks several resistance levels, like the moving average, prior swing highs, and trend lines, and each by many ticks.
>Reversal attempts in the form of spikes against the trend have no follow-through, fail, and become flags in the direction of the trend.


以下是强劲趋势中常见的特性：

- 当天出现**大的跳空开盘**。
- 存在**趋势性的高点和低点（摆动）**。
- 大多数K线是**顺应趋势的趋势K线**。
- 连续K线的**实体重叠极少**。例如，在牛市急涨中，许多K线的低点与前一根K线的收盘价相同或仅低一个跳动点。有些K线的低点与前一根K线的收盘价相同，甚至没有低于收盘价，因此试图以前一根K线收盘价的限价单买入的交易者无法成交，不得不以更高的价格买入。
- K线**没有影线或影线很小**，表明交易具有紧迫性。例如，在牛市趋势中，如果一根看涨趋势K线以其最低价开盘并向上运行，交易者会迫不及待地在前一根K线收盘后立即买入。如果它以接近或等于其最高价收盘，交易者会继续强劲买入，预期在该K线收盘后立即会有新的买家入场。他们愿意在收盘前买入，因为他们担心如果等待K线收盘，可能不得不以一两个跳动点更高的价格买入。
- 偶尔，**K线实体之间出现缺口**（例如，在牛市趋势中，一根K线的开盘价可能高于前一根K线的收盘价）。
- **突破缺口**以强劲趋势K线的形式出现在趋势的起始阶段。
- **衡量缺口**出现在突破测试没有与突破点重叠的地方。例如，牛市突破后的回调没有跌破发生突破的K线的高点。
- **微型衡量缺口**出现在存在强劲趋势K线以及它前后K线之间存在缺口的地方。例如，在牛市趋势中，如果一根强劲看涨趋势K线之后的K线的低点，与该趋势K线之前的K线的高点相同或更高，这是一个缺口，也是一个突破测试，同时是强势的标志。
- **没有出现大的高潮**。
- **没有出现很多大实体K线**（即使是大实体趋势K线）。通常，最大的趋势K线是逆势的，这使得交易者被诱导去寻找逆势交易，从而错过了顺势交易。逆势形态几乎总是看起来比顺势形态更好。？
- **没有发生显著的趋势通道线超调**，即使是次要的超调也只会导致横盘调整。
- 在趋势线被突破后出现**横盘调整**。
- **失败的楔形和其他失败的反转**出现。？
- 出现一系列**20根移动平均线缺口K线**（20根或更多连续K线未触及移动平均线，在第二本书中讨论）。
- **很少（如果有的话）发现有利可图的逆势交易**。
- 回调幅度**小、不频繁且大多呈横盘整理**。例如，如果Emini的平均波动范围是12点，那么所有的回调可能都小于三四个点，市场通常会连续五根或更多K线而不出现回调。
- 存在一种**紧迫感**。你会发现自己等待了无数根K线，希望能等到一个好的顺势回调，但它从未出现，而市场却缓慢地继续保持趋势。
- 回调具有**强劲的形态**。例如，牛市趋势中的高点1和高点2回调具有强劲的看涨反转K线作为信号K线。？
- 在最强劲的趋势中，回调通常具有**弱信号K线**，这导致许多交易者不进行交易，并迫使交易者追涨杀跌。例如，在熊市趋势中，做空低点2的信号K线通常是两三根看涨急涨中的小型看涨K线，并且一些入场K线是向下外包K线。？
- 它具有**趋势性的“任何东西”**：收盘价、高点、低点或实体。
- **重复的两腿回调**正在形成顺势入场机会。？
- 没有连续两根趋势K线的收盘价出现在移动平均线的**对侧**。
- 趋势走得非常远，**突破了多个阻力位**，如移动平均线、之前的摆动高点和趋势线，并且每个突破都达到很多跳动点。
- 针对趋势的反转尝试，以**尖刺形式出现，但没有后续动能，最终失败，并演变成顺势的旗形**。

>The more of the following characteristics that a bull breakout has, the more likely the breakout will be strong:
>
>• The breakout bar has a large bull trend body and small tails or no tails. The larger the bar,the more likely the breakout will succeed.
>• If the volume of the large breakout bar is 10 to 20 times the average volume of recent bars,the chance of follow-through buying and a possible measured move increases.
>• The spike goes very far, lasts several bars, and breaks several resistance levels, like the moving average, prior swing highs, and trend lines, and each by many ticks.
>• As the first bar of the breakout bar is forming, it spends most of its time near its high and the pullbacks are small (less than a quarter of the height of the growing bar).
>• There is a sense of urgency. You feel like you have to buy but you want a pull-back, yet it never comes.
>• The next two or three bars also have bull bodies that are at least the average size of the recent bull and bear bodies. Even if the bodies are relatively small and the tails are prominent,if the follow-through bar (the bar after the initial breakout bar) is large, the odds of the trend continuing are greater.
>• The spike grows to five to 10 bars without pulling back for more than a bar or so.
>• One or more bars in the spike have a low that is at or just one tick below the close of the prior bar.
>• One or more bars in the spike have an open that is above the close of the prior bar.
>• One or more bars in the spike have a close on the bar's high or just one tick below its high.
>• The low of the bar after a bull trend bar is at or above the high of the bar before the bull trend bar, creating a micro gap, which is a sign of strength. These gaps sometimes become measuring gaps. Although it is not significant to trading, according to Elliott Wave Theory they probably represent the space between a smaller time frame Elliott Wave 1 high and a Wave 4pullback, which can touch but not overlap.
>• The overall context makes a breakout likely, like the resumption of a trend after a pullback,or a higher low or lower low test of the bear low after a strong break above the bear trend line.
>• The market has had several strong bull trend days recently.
>• There is growing buying pressure in the trading range, represented by many large bull trend bars, and the bull trend bars are clearly more prominent than the bear trend bars in the range.
>• The first pullback occurs only after three or more bars of breaking out.
>• The first pullback lasts only one or two bars, and it follows a bar that is not a strong bear reversal bar.
>• The first pullback does not reach the breakout point and does not hit a breakeven stop (the entry price).
>• The breakout reverses many recent closes and highs. For example, when there is a bear channel and a large bull bar forms, this breakout bar has a high and close that are above the highs and closes of five or even 20 or more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the close of the bull bar is a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by the high.

以下是判断一个**看涨突破（Bull Breakout）** 是否强劲的常见特征，符合的特征越多，突破越可能强劲：

- **突破K线具有大的看涨趋势实体且影线很小或没有影线。** K线越大，突破成功的可能性越大。
- 如果大的突破K线的**成交量是近期K线平均成交量的10到20倍**，那么后续买盘和可能出现的等幅测量走势（measured move）的机会就会增加。
- **价格急涨走势非常远，持续多根K线，并突破了多个阻力位**，例如移动平均线、之前的摆动高点和趋势线，并且每个突破都幅度很大。
- 当突破K线形成时，它大部分时间都接近其高点，并且**回调很小**（小于正在增长的K线高度的四分之一）。
- 存在一种**紧迫感**。你感觉必须买入，但你希望有回调，然而回调从未出现。
- 随后的两到三根K线也具有看涨实体，其大小至少等于近期看涨和看跌实体的平均大小。即使实体相对较小，影线突出，如果后续K线（初始突破K线之后的K线）很大，趋势持续的可能性也更大。
- 价格急涨持续五到十根K线，**期间没有超过一根K线左右的回调**。
- 急涨中的一根或多根K线的**低点与前一根K线的收盘价相同或仅低一个跳动点**。
- 急涨中的一根或多根K线的**开盘价高于前一根K线的收盘价**。
- 急涨中的一根或多根K线的**收盘价在K线高点或仅低于其高点一个跳动点**。
- **看涨趋势K线之后的K线低点，与该看涨趋势K线之前的K线高点相同或更高**，这形成了一个微型缺口，是强势的标志。这些缺口有时会成为衡量缺口。尽管对交易本身不重要，但根据艾略特波浪理论，它们可能代表了较小时间框架艾略特波浪1高点和波浪4回调之间的空间，后者可以触及但不能重叠。
- **整体市场背景使得突破可能发生**，例如回调后趋势的恢复，或者在强劲突破熊市趋势线后对熊市低点的更高低点或更低低点测试。
- **市场近期出现多日强劲的看涨趋势日**。
- **交易区间内买盘压力不断增强**，表现为许多大型看涨趋势K线，且区间内看涨趋势K线明显比看跌趋势K线更突出。
- **第一次回调只发生在突破三根或更多K线之后**。
- **第一次回调仅持续一两根K线**，并且它不是一根强劲的看跌反转K线之后的回调。
- **第一次回调没有达到突破点，也没有触及盈亏平衡止损位（入场价格）**。
- **突破反转了近期许多收盘价和高点**。例如，当存在一个熊市通道并形成一根大型看涨K线时，这根突破K线的高点和收盘价高于五根甚至二十根或更多K线的高点和收盘价。由看涨K线收盘价反转的K线数量越多，比由高点反转的相同数量K线更能说明强势。

### 反转K线：识别市场转向的关键信号

最广为人知的信号K线就是**反转K线**。

#### 看涨反转K线 (Bull Reversal Bar)

一根看涨反转K线至少应该具备以下特征之一：**收盘价高于开盘价（形成看涨实体），或者收盘价高于K线中点。**

最好的看涨反转K线通常具备以下多个特征：

- **开盘价接近或低于前一根K线的收盘价**，并且**收盘价高于开盘价**，同时**高于前一根K线的收盘价**。
- **下影线大约是K线高度的三分之一到二分之一**，上影线则很小或不存在。
- 与前一根或多根K线**重叠不多**。
- 信号K线之后的K线**不是十字星内包K线**，而是一根**强劲的入场K线**（即一根实体相对较大、影线较小的看涨趋势K线）。
- **收盘价反转（收盘高于）多根K线的收盘价和最高点。**

#### 看跌反转K线 (Bear Reversal Bar)

一根看跌反转K线至少应该具备以下特征之一：**收盘价低于开盘价（形成看跌实体），或者收盘价低于K线中点。**

最好的看跌反转K线通常具备以下多个特征：

- **开盘价接近或高于前一根K线的收盘价**，并且**收盘价远低于前一根K线的收盘价**。
- **上影线大约是K线高度的三分之一到二分之一**，下影线则很小或不存在。
- 与前一根或多根K线**重叠不多**。
- 信号K线之后的K线**不是十字星内包K线**，而是一根**强劲的入场K线**（即一根实体相对较大、影线较小的看跌趋势K线）。
- **收盘价反转（收盘低于）多根K线的收盘价和极值（最高点/最低点）。**

>Here are a number of characteristics that are common in strong bull reversals:
>
>• There is a strong bull reversal bar with a large bull trend body and small tails or no tails.
>• The next two or three bars also have bull bodies that are at least the average size of the recent bull and bear bodies.
>• The spike grows to five to 10 bars without pulling back for more than a bar or so, and it reverses many bars, swing highs, and bear flags of the prior bear trend.
>• One or more bars in the spike have a low that is at or just one tick below the close of the prior bar.
>• One or more bars in the spike have an open that is above the close of the prior bar.
>• One or more bars in the spike have a close on the high of the bar or just one tick below its high.
>• The overall context makes a reversal likely, like a higher low or lower low test of the bear low after a strong break above the bear trend line.
>• The first pullback occurs only after three or more bars.
>• The first pullback lasts only one or two bars, and it follows a bar that is not a strong bear reversal bar.
>• The first pullback does not hit a breakeven stop (the entry price).
>• The spike goes very far and breaks several resistance levels like the moving average, prior swing highs, and trend lines, and each by many ticks.
>• As the first bar of the reversal is forming, it spends most of its time near its high and the pullbacks are less than a quarter of the height of the growing bar.
>• There is a sense of urgency. You feel like you have to buy but you want a pull-back, yet it never comes.
>• The signal is the second attempt to reverse within the past few bars (a second signal).
>• The reversal began as a reversal from an overshoot of a trend channel line from the old trend.
>• It is reversing a significant swing high or low (e.g., it breaks below a strong prior swing low and reverses up).
>• The high 1 and high 2 pullbacks have strong bull reversal bars for signal bars.
>• It has trending "anything": closes, highs, lows, or bodies.
>• The pullbacks are small and sideways.
>• There were prior breaks of earlier bear trend lines (this isn't the first sign of bullish strength).
>• The pullback to test the bear low lacks momentum, as evidenced by its having many overlapping bars with many being bull trend bars.
>• The pullback that tests the bear low fails at the moving average or the old bear trend line.
>• The breakout reverses many recent closes and highs. For example, when there is a bear channel and a large bull bar forms, this breakout bar has a high and close that are above the highs and closes of five or even 20 or more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the close of the bull bar is a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by only its high.

### 强势看涨反转的常见特征

以下是强劲的**看涨反转 (Bull Reversals)** 中常见的多种特性：

- 急涨中的一根或多根K线，其**开盘价高于前一根K线的收盘价**。
- 急涨中的一根或多根K线，其**收盘价在K线高点或仅低于其高点一个跳动点**。
- 整体市场背景使得反转可能发生，例如在强劲突破熊市趋势线后，对熊市低点进行更高低点或更低低点的测试。
- 第一次回调发生在**三根或更多K线之后**。
- 第一次回调仅持续一两根K线，并且它不是一根强劲的看跌反转K线之后的回调。
- 第一次回调**没有触及盈亏平衡止损位（入场价格）**。
- 急涨走势非常远，**突破了多个阻力位**，例如移动平均线、之前的摆动高点和趋势线，并且每个突破都幅度很大。
- 当反转的第一根K线形成时，它大部分时间都接近其高点，并且**回调幅度小于正在增长的K线高度的四分之一**。
- 存在一种**紧迫感**。你感觉必须买入，但你希望有回调，然而回调从未出现。
- 这个信号是**过去几根K线内第二次尝试反转**（一个二次信号）。
- 反转始于对旧趋势通道线**超调后的反转**。
- 它正在反转一个重要的**摆动高点或低点**（例如，它跌破一个强劲的先前摆动低点后反转向上）。
- 高点1和高点2回调具有强劲的看涨反转K线作为信号K线。
- 它具有**趋势性的“任何东西”**：收盘价、高点、低点或实体。
- 回调是**小型且横盘的**。
- 之前已发生过对更早期熊市趋势线的突破（这并非看涨力量的第一个迹象）。
- 测试熊市低点的回调缺乏动能，表现为具有许多重叠K线，其中许多是看涨趋势K线。
- 测试熊市低点的回调在移动平均线或旧的熊市趋势线处失败。
- 突破反转了近期许多收盘价和高点。例如，当存在一个熊市通道并形成一根大型看涨K线时，这根突破K线的高点和收盘价高于五根甚至二十根或更多K线的高点和收盘价。由看涨K线收盘价反转的K线数量越多，比由高点反转的相同数量K线更能说明强势。

>• The low 1 and low 2 pullbacks have strong bear reversal bars for signal bars.
>• It has trending "anything": closes, highs, lows, or bodies.
>• The pullbacks are small and sideways.
>• There were prior breaks of earlier bull trend lines (this isn't the first sign of bearish strength).
>• The pullback to test the bull high lacks momentum, as evidenced by it having many overlapping bars with many being bear trend bars.
>• The pullback that tests the bull high fails at the moving average or the old bull trend line.
>• The breakout reverses many recent closes and lows. For example, when there is a bull channel and a large bear bar forms, this breakout bar has a low and close that are below the lows and closes of five or even 20 or more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the close of the bear bar is a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by only its low.

### 强势看跌反转的常见特征

以下是强劲的**看跌反转 (Bear Reversals)** 中常见的多种特性：

- 有一个**强劲的看跌反转K线**，带有大的看跌趋势实体和很小或没有影线。
- 接下来的两三根K线也具有看跌实体，其大小至少达到近期看涨和看跌实体的平均水平。
- 急跌走势持续五到十根K线，**期间没有超过一根左右的反弹**，并且它反转了之前牛市趋势中的多根K线、摆动低点和牛旗。
- 急跌中的一根或多根K线，其**高点与前一根K线的收盘价相同或仅高一个跳动点**。
- 急跌中的一根或多根K线，其**开盘价低于前一根K线的收盘价**。
- 急跌中的一根或多根K线，其**收盘价在K线低点或仅高于其低点一个跳动点**。
- 整体市场背景使得反转可能发生，例如在强劲跌破牛市趋势线后，对牛市高点进行更低高点或更高高点的测试。
- 第一次反弹发生在**三根或更多K线之后**。
- 第一次反弹仅持续一两根K线，并且它不是一根强劲的看涨反转K线之后的反弹。
- 第一次反弹**没有触及盈亏平衡止损位（入场价格）**。
- 急跌走势非常远，**突破了多个支撑位**，例如移动平均线、之前的摆动低点和趋势线，并且每个突破都幅度很大。
- 当反转的第一根K线形成时，它大部分时间都接近其低点，并且**反弹幅度小于正在增长的K线高度的四分之一**。
- 存在一种**紧迫感**。你感觉必须卖出，但你希望有反弹，然而反弹从未出现。
- 这个信号是**过去几根K线内第二次尝试反转**（一个二次信号）。
- 反转始于对旧趋势通道线**超调后的反转**。
- 它正在**重要的摆动高点或低点区域反转**（例如，突破一个强劲的先前摆动高点后反转下跌）。
- 低点1和低点2回调具有强劲的看跌反转K线作为信号K线。
- 它具有**趋势性的“任何东西”**：收盘价、高点、低点或实体。
- 反弹是**小型且横盘的**。
- 之前已发生过对更早期牛市趋势线的突破（这并非看跌力量的第一个迹象）。
- 测试牛市高点的反弹缺乏动能，表现为具有许多重叠K线，其中许多是看跌趋势K线。
- 测试牛市高点的反弹在移动平均线或旧的牛市趋势线处失败。
- 突破反转了近期许多收盘价和低点。例如，当存在一个牛市通道并形成一根大型看跌K线时，这根突破K线的低点和收盘价低于五根甚至二十根或更多K线的低点和收盘价。由看跌K线收盘价反转的K线数量越多，比由低点反转的相同数量K线更能说明强势。

>BAR COUNTING BASICS: HIGH 1, HIGH 2, LOW 1, LOW 2
>
>A reliable sign that a pullback in a bull trend or in a trading range has ended is when the current bar's high extends at least one tick above the high of the prior bar. 
>
>This leads to a useful concept of counting the number of times that this occurs, which is called bar counting.In a sideways or downward move in a bull trend or a trading range, the first bar whose high is above the high of the prior bar is a high 1, and this ends the first leg of the sideways or down move, although this leg may become a small leg in a larger pullback. If the market does not turn into a bull swing and instead continues sideways or down, label the next occurrence of a bar with a high above the high of the prior bar as a high 2, ending the second leg.
>
>A high 2 in a bull trend and a low 2 in a bear trend are often referred to as ABC corrections where the first leg is the A, the change in direction that forms the high 1 or low 1 entry is the B,and the final leg of the pullback is the C. The breakout from the C is a high 2 entry bar in a bull ABC correction and a low 2 entry bar in a bear ABC correction.
>
>If the bull pullback ends after a third leg, the buy setup is a high 3 and is usually a type of wedge bull flag. When a bear rally ends in a third leg, it is a low 3 sell setup and usually a wedge bear flag.
>
>Some bull pullbacks can grow further and form a high 4. When a high 4 forms, it sometimes begins with a high 2 and this high 2 fails to go very far. It is instead followed by another two legs down and a second high 2, and the entire move is simply a high 2 in a higher time frame.At other times, the high 4 is a small spike and channel bear trend where the first or second push down is a bear spike and the next pushes down are in a bear channel. If the high 4 fails to resume the trend and the market falls below its low, it is likely that the market is no longer forming a pullback in a bull trend and instead is in a bear swing. Wait for more price action to unfold before placing a trade.
>
>When a bear trend or a sideways market is correcting sideways or up, the first bar with a low below the low of the prior bar is a low 1, ending the first leg of the correction, which can be as brief as that single bar. Subsequent occurrences are called the low 2, low 3, and low 4 entries.If the low 4 fails (a bar extends above the high of the low 4 signal bar after the low 4 short is triggered), the price action indicates that the bears have lost control and either the market will become two-sided, with bulls and bears alternating control, or the bulls will gain control. In any case, the bears can best demonstrate that they have regained control by breaking a bull trend line with strong momentum.

## K线计数基础：高点1，高点2，低点1，低点2

在牛市趋势或交易区间内，回调结束的一个可靠迹象是当前K线的高点至少比前一根K线的高点高出一个跳动点。

这引出了一个有用的概念，即统计这种现象发生的次数，这被称为**K线计数**。在牛市趋势或交易区间内，当市场横向或向下移动时，第一根高点高于前一根K线高点的K线被称为**高点1 (High 1)**，这标志着横向或向下移动的第一条腿结束，尽管这条腿可能是更大回调中的一小部分。如果市场没有转变为牛市摆动，而是继续横向或向下移动，则将下一次高点高于前一根K线高点的K线标记为**高点2 (High 2)**，结束第二条腿。

牛市趋势中的**高点2**和熊市趋势中的**低点2**通常被称为**ABC回调**，其中第一条腿是A，形成高点1或低点1入场的方向变化是B，回调的最后一条腿是C。C点突破是牛市ABC回调中的高点2入场K线，是熊市ABC回调中的低点2入场K线。

如果牛市回调在第三条腿后结束，买入形态是**高点3 (High 3)**，通常是一种**楔形牛旗**。当熊市反弹在第三条腿后结束时，它是**低点3 (Low 3)** 卖出形态，通常是一种**楔形熊旗**。

一些牛市回调可能会进一步发展并形成**高点4 (High 4)**。当高点4形成时，它有时始于一个高点2，但这个高点2未能走得很远。相反，它随后又出现了另外两条腿的下跌和一个第二个高点2，而整个走势只是更高时间框架中的一个高点2。在其他时候，高点4是一个小型的急涨和通道熊市趋势，其中第一次或第二次下跌是熊市急涨，随后的下跌在熊市通道中。如果高点4未能恢复趋势，并且市场跌破其低点，则市场很可能不再形成牛市趋势中的回调，而是处于熊市摆动中。在进行交易之前，请等待更多的价格行为展开。

当熊市趋势或横盘市场进行横向或向上调整时，第一根低点低于前一根K线低点的K线是**低点1 (Low 1)**，结束调整的第一条腿，这条腿可以短至单根K线。随后的出现被称为**低点2 (Low 2)**、**低点3 (Low 3)** 和 **低点4 (Low 4)** 入场。如果低点4失败（在低点4空头被触发后，一根K线延伸到低点4信号K线的高点之上），价格行为表明空头已经失去控制，市场要么变得双向，多头和空头交替控制，要么多头将获得控制。无论哪种情况，空头最好通过以强劲动能突破牛市趋势线来表明他们已经重新获得控制。
