>Trends days can be classified into specific types, and if you become familiar with the characteristics of each type, you will be prepared to spot specific trading opportunities as they are setting up. The names are meaningless because all that a trader needs to know is how to read the price action, which is the same for any pattern. On most trend days, features of more than one type of trend will be present, but don't look at that with confusion or disappointment. Instead, it is an opportunity because there will be more tradable setups once you become familiar with how each tends to develop.


>With all trend patterns, the only reason to apply names to them is because they are commonly recurring patterns; if you recognize one as it is unfolding, you should be focusing on trading in the with-trend direction only and be more confident about swinging a larger part of your trade. The setups will be the same as during trading range days, but you should be trying to take every with-trend entry, no matter how weak the setup looks, and you should take countertrend entries only after a trend line break, only  if there is a good reversal bar, and only if you are still able to take every with-trend signal. If you find that you are missing any with-trend entries, stop trading countertrend and focus only on with-trend setups. On the countertrend trades, you should scalp your entire position. Also, you should not find more than two or three countertrend trades in the day; if you do, you are spending too much time looking in the wrong direction and likely missing great with-trend swings. The stronger the trend, the more you need to be swinging with the trend and not scalping countertrend. In a very strong trend, all trades should be with-trend swings (scalping out part) and no trades should be countertrend scalps, as tempting as they are.


>The opening range usually provides clues to how the day will unfold, and these are discussed in detail in the section on opening patterns and reversals in the third book. In general, if the opening range is small, it will be followed by a breakout. If the opening range is about half of the range of the recent days, the breakout will often lead to a measured move and a trending trading range day. If the opening range is large, there is usually a spike and the day will likely become a spike and channel trend day.

>Once you are familiar with these patterns, you will find that you can see them potentially setting up in the first 30 to 60 minutes. If you do, make sure to take every with-trend trade and swing part of your position. Sometimes you will get stopped out of the swing portion a couple of times, but keep swinging a part because if the day becomes a trend day, a single swing can be as profitable as 10 scalps.


>As a corollary, if you cannot see one of these patterns setting up, then assume that the day is a trading range day and look for entries in both directions. Also, a trend day can turn into a trading range day or a trend in the opposite direction at any time. When it happens, don't question it or be upset by it. Just accept it and trade it.

##### 趋势日的分类与交易策略
#心法 #策略 #技巧
*我可以做到什么：熟悉每种类型的趋势日的特征，在**交易机会**形成之初就识别它们。*
趋势日可以根据其特定类型进行分类。如果您熟悉每种类型的特征，就能在**交易机会**形成之初就识别它们。这些名称本身并不重要，因为交易者真正需要了解的是如何解读价格行为，这对于任何模式都是一样的。在大多数趋势日中，会同时出现多种趋势类型的特征，但这不应让您感到困惑或失望。相反，这是一种机会，因为一旦您熟悉每种趋势如何发展，就会有更多的可交易“交易机会”。

对于所有趋势模式，给它们命名唯一的原因是它们是常见且反复出现的模式；如果您在趋势展开时识别出其中一种，就应该只专注于**顺势方向的交易**，并对**波段持有**更大比例的仓位更有信心。入场“交易机会”将与**交易区间**日相同，但您应该尝试抓住每一个**顺势入场**，无论“交易机会”看起来多么微弱。
您只应在**趋势线突破后**、**有良好的反转K线出现时**，并且**仍能抓住每一个顺势信号的情况下**，才进行**逆势入场**。
如果您发现自己错过了任何顺势入场，就停止逆势交易，只专注于**顺势“交易机会”**。
在逆势交易中，您应该**剥头皮**平仓所有头寸。
此外，您不应该在一天中发现超过两到三个逆势交易；如果发现更多，说明您花太多时间在错误的方向上，很可能错过了绝佳的顺势波段。
趋势越强劲，您就越需要**顺势波段交易**，而不是逆势剥头皮。在非常强劲的趋势中，所有交易都应该是顺势波段（部分剥头皮），不应该有任何逆势剥头皮交易，尽管它们可能很诱人。

##### 开盘区间的线索与趋势预测

**开盘区间**通常会提供关于当天市场如何展开的线索，这些在第三本书关于开盘模式和反转的章节中有详细讨论。
#重点 #技巧
如果开盘区间很小，随后会有一个**突破**。
如果开盘区间约为近期日波动范围的一半，那么突破通常会导致一个**量度移动**和一个**趋势性交易区间日**。
如果开盘区间很大，通常会有一个**急涨**，并且当天很可能成为**急涨通道型趋势日**。

一旦您熟悉了这些模式，您会发现在最初的30到60分钟内，您就能看到它们潜在的形成。如果您看到了，请务必抓住每一个**顺势交易**，并**波段持有**部分仓位。有时您可能会被止损出波段仓位几次，但请继续波段持有部分仓位，因为如果当天成为一个趋势日，一次波段交易的利润可能相当于10次剥头皮交易。

##### 灵活应对市场变化
#重点 #技巧
因此，如果您无法看到其中任何一种模式正在形成，那么就假定当天是一个**交易区间日**，并寻找双向入场机会。
此外，一个趋势日随时可能转变为**交易区间日**或向相反方向的趋势。当这种情况发生时，不要质疑或沮丧。只需接受并进行交易。
