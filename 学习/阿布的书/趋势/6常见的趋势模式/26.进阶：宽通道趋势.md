>Primary characteristics of stairs days:
>
>• A stairs day is a variant of a trending trading range day where there are at least three trading ranges.
>• The day has broad swings, but trending highs and lows.
>• Because the swings are large, traders can usually place trades in both directions, but they should try to swing part or all of their with-trend trades.
>• Almost every breakout is followed by a pullback (a breakout test) beyond the breakout point, so that there is some overlap between consecutive swings. For example, in a broad bear channel, every breakout to a new low is followed by a rally that goes back above the breakout point but stays below the most recent swing high. However, there is sometimes a swing or two that will extend above the prior swing high by a little. This will make some traders wonder if the market is reversing, but the trend will usually soon resume.
>• If each breakout gets a little smaller than the prior one, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern and a sign of waning momentum, which can lead to a larger correction.

##### 阶梯形态日的主要特征

**阶梯形态日**是**趋势交易区间日**的一种变体，其中至少有三个交易区间。

- **宽幅摆动与趋势性高低点**：这一天有宽幅的摆动，但高点和低点呈现趋势性。
    
- **双向交易与顺势波段**：由于摆动幅度大，交易者通常可以双向交易，但他们应该尝试持有部分或全部顺势交易的波段。
    
- **突破后的回调与重叠**：几乎每一次**突破**之后都会出现回调（**突破测试**），并且回调会超出**突破点**，这样连续的摆动之间会有一些重叠。例如，在一个宽幅熊市通道中，每次突破新低之后都会出现反弹，反弹会回到**突破点**上方，但会保持在最近摆动高点下方。然而，有时会有一两个摆动会稍微超出先前的摆动高点。这会让一些交易者怀疑市场是否正在反转，但趋势通常很快就会恢复。
    
- **缩小型阶梯形态与动能减弱**：如果每次**突破**都比前一次小一点，那么这就是一个**缩小型阶梯形态**，是动能减弱的迹象，可能导致更大的修正。

>When a market has a series of three or more trending swings that resemble a mildly sloping trading range or channel, both the bulls and the bears are active but one side is exerting somewhat more control. Each pullback retraces beyond its breakout point, creating overlap between each breakout spike and the following pullback. Two-way trading is taking place within the broad channel, so traders can look for entries in both directions. If the breakouts get smaller and smaller, then this is a shrinking stairs pattern and indicates waning momentum. It often leads to a two-legged reversal and a trend line break. Many three-push reversals qualify as stairs or shrinking stairs trends that failed and reversed. Stairs are often just pullbacks or flags in higher time frame trends, and it is common to see stairs over the final hour or two of the day and then a breakout of the flag on the open of the next day. For example, a broad bull channel today might just be a large bear flag, and the bear trend could break out tomorrow.
>Alternatively, one stair might suddenly accelerate and break out of the trend channel in the with-trend direction. If it then reverses, this overshoot and reversal will likely result in at least a two-legged move. If it does not, the breakout will probably continue for at least two more legs or at least the approximate height of the channel in an imprecise measured move (the distance beyond the channel should be about the same as the distance within the channel).
>Traders pay attention to how many ticks breakouts run past the most recent swing point, and then use that number to fade subsequent breakouts, expecting a breakout test. For example,if the last swing low fell 14 ticks below the swing low before it, traders will look to scale into longs beginning around 10 ticks below the most recent swing low, which will usually be around the trend channel line. If the pullback from the most recent breakout was about 15ticks, they will look to take profits around 10 to 15 ticks up from the low, which will usually be around the trend line (the top of the bear channel).

当市场出现三个或更多类似轻微倾斜的交易区间或通道的趋势性摆动时，多头和空头都活跃，但一方掌握了更多控制权。每次回调都回溯到其**突破点**之外，从而在每个**突破飙升**和随后的回调之间产生重叠。宽幅通道内正在进行双向交易，因此交易者可以寻找双向入场机会。如果突破变得越来越小，那么这就是一个**缩小型阶梯形态**，表明动能减弱。它通常会导致**两腿反转**和**趋势线突破**。许多三推反转符合**阶梯形态**或**缩小型阶梯形态趋势**，它们失败并反转了。

**阶梯形态**在更高时间框架趋势中通常只是回调或旗形，并且在当天最后的一两个小时内常见，然后第二天开盘时突破旗形。例如，今天一个宽幅的牛市通道可能只是一个大型熊市旗形，熊市趋势可能会在明天突破。

---

##### 阶梯形态的加速与反转

或者，一个**阶梯形态**可能会突然加速并突破趋势通道，方向与趋势相同。如果它随后反转，这种**过度突破和反转**很可能导致至少两腿的走势。如果不是，突破可能会继续至少再走两腿，或者至少以不精确的**等幅测量走势**（通道之外的距离应该与通道内的距离大致相同）达到通道的大致高度。

---

##### 突破的跳动点与回调的利用

交易者会关注**突破**超过最近摆动点的跳动点数量，然后利用这个数字**逆势交易**随后的突破，预期会进行**突破测试**。例如，如果上一个摆动低点比其之前的摆动低点低了 14 个跳动点，交易者将考虑从最近摆动低点下方约 10 个跳动点开始分批做多，这通常会在趋势通道线附近。如果最近突破后的回调约为 15 个跳动点，他们将考虑在从低点上涨约 10 到 15 个跳动点时获利了结，这通常会在趋势线（熊市通道的顶部）附近。

>A bear stairs pattern is a downwardly sloping channel where each breakout to a new low is followed by a pullback that goes back above the breakout point. For example, in Figure 26.1the breakout leg below bar 6 down to bar 9 was followed by a pullback that went back above the bar 7 low, and the rally after the leg that broke below bar 9 down to bar 13 was followed by a pullback that went above the bar 9 breakout point, overlapping the prior range.
>Some traders buy near the trend channel line and short near the trend line. Other traders pay attention to how far a breakout goes before there is a pull-back. For example, the low of bar 5was about four points below the low of bar 3. Aggressive bulls placed limit orders to buy at about three to four points below the low of bar 5. They were not filled on the sell-off to bar 7.However, as the market fell below bar 7, they again placed limit orders to buy three to four points lower, and were filled on the move down to bar 9, which had a low that was four points below the low of bar 7. Since prior rallies were about four points, they took profits at around three points above their entries. They did the same on the sell-offs to bars 11 and 16. They tried on the sell-off to bar 13, but the market did not fall far enough for their orders to get filled. Bears did the opposite. They saw that past rallies were about four to six points, so they scaled into shorts around three to five points above the most recent swing low, which was in the area of the bear trendline. This style of trading is only for experienced traders. Beginners should restrict themselves to stop entries, so that the market is already going their way (this is discussed in the second book).
>Bar 7 was the third push down and a shrinking stair (it extended less below bar 5 than bar 5extended below bar 3). The channel lines are drawn as best fit lines to highlight that the market is trending down and in a channel. There is clearly two-sided trading and traders should be buying the lows and selling the highs when they see appropriate setups.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The market opened near the bottom of the bear channel that started yesterday in Figure 26.1and broke out below the channel. The breakout failed with a two-bar reversal that led to a four-bar bull spike. After a double top that tested the bear trend line (drawn as a parallel of the best fit trend channel line), the market had a spike down to bar 13. With both bull and bear spikes, the two sides were fighting over the direction of the expected channel. The bulls started a channel but it failed at the trend line and reversed down in a bear channel. The market reversed up from a test of the trend channel line where the bar 1 6 low could not reach the line. This is a sign of aggressive buying. The bar 1 6 two-bar reversal was also a final flag long setup from the bar 15 four-bar final flag.
>Three pushes down does not guarantee a trend reversal. The move down to bar 7 had very little buying pressure. There were no large bull trend bars and no strong climactic reversals.The move up from bar 7 was also not particularly strong. This was not how strong reversals typically look, and because of that, it did not attract enough strong bulls to reverse the market. Instead, the market formed a wedge bear flag (bar 6 and then the two small pushes up from bar 7 were the three pushes) and a lower high (although the rally was above bar 6 and therefore a sign of some strength, it was still below bar 4), and the bear trend resumed.

##### 熊市阶梯形态的特征

**熊市阶梯形态**是一个向下倾斜的通道，其中每一次**突破**新低之后都会出现回调，回调会回到**突破点**之上。例如，在图 26.1 中，从 K 线 6 跌至 K 线 9 的突破腿之后，出现了一次回调，回调回到了 K 线 7 低点之上；而跌破 K 线 9 到 K 线 13 的腿之后出现的回调，回到了 K 线 9 **突破点**之上，与先前的区间重叠。

---

##### 交易策略与风险控制

有些交易者会在趋势通道线附近买入，并在趋势线附近做空。另一些交易者则关注**突破**在回调之前走了多远。例如，K 线 5 的低点比 K 线 3 的低点低了大约四点。激进的多头会在 K 线 5 低点下方大约三到四点处设置限价买入订单。他们在跌至 K 线 7 时没有成交。然而，当市场跌破 K 线 7 时，他们再次在下方三到四点处设置限价买入订单，并在跌至 K 线 9 时成交，K 线 9 的低点比 K 线 7 的低点低了四点。由于之前的反弹大约是四点，他们在大约高于入场点三点处获利了结。他们在跌至 K 线 11 和 16 时也做了同样的事情。他们在跌至 K 线 13 时尝试了，但市场没有跌到足以让他们的订单成交。

空头则反向操作。他们看到过去的反弹大约是四到六点，因此他们在最近的摆动低点上方大约三到五点处分批做空，这在熊市趋势线区域。这种交易风格只适合经验丰富的交易者。初学者应该限制自己使用止损入场，这样市场就已经朝着他们的方向运行（这在第二本书中讨论）。

---

##### 缩小型阶梯形态与两边交易

K 线 7 是第三次向下推动，也是一个**缩小型阶梯形态**（它低于 K 线 5 的延伸幅度小于 K 线 5 低于 K 线 3 的延伸幅度）。通道线被绘制成最佳拟合线，以突出显示市场正在向下趋势运行并在一个通道中。市场明显存在双向交易，当交易者看到合适的**交易机会**时，应该买入低点，卖出高点。

##### 图表深入探讨：开盘、反转与买卖双方的博弈

市场在图 26.1 中昨日开始的熊市通道底部附近开盘，并突破了通道。这次突破以两 K 线反转失败，导致四 K 线牛市飙升。在对熊市趋势线进行**双重顶测试**（绘制为最佳拟合趋势通道线的平行线）之后，市场急剧下跌至 K 线 13。在牛市和熊市飙升中，双方都在争夺预期通道的方向。多头开始了一个通道，但它在趋势线处失败并反转下跌，进入熊市通道。市场从对趋势通道线的测试中反转上涨，K 线 16 低点未能触及该线。这是激进买盘的迹象。K 线 16 的两 K 线反转也是 K 线 15 四 K 线**最终旗形**的**最终旗形多头交易机会**。

三次向下推动并不能保证趋势反转。跌至 K 线 7 的走势买盘压力很小。没有大型牛市趋势 K 线，也没有强劲的**高潮式反转**。从 K 线 7 上涨的走势也不是特别强劲。这不像强劲反转通常的样子，因此它没有吸引足够多的强大多头来反转市场。相反，市场形成了一个**楔形熊市旗形**（K 线 6，然后从 K 线 7 的两次小幅向上推动是三次推动）和更低的高点（尽管反弹高于 K 线 6，因此是某种强势的迹象，但仍低于 K 线 4），熊市趋势恢复。

>A stairs pattern can accelerate into a stronger trend (see Figure 26.2). By bar 7, the EUR/USD forex chart had three higher highs and lows in a channel and therefore formed a stair type of bull trend.
>Bar 8 was a bull trend bar that broke out of the top of the channel, and it was followed by a bear reversal bar that never triggered a short. The breakout should extend to about a measured move up to a parallel line that is about the same distance from the middle line as the middle line is from the bottom line (an Andrew's Pitchfork move), which it did. The acceleration upward is typical when a wedge top fails. There were three pushes up that ended at bar 6, but you could also view the small swing high just before bar 8 as the third push up if you restarted your count with the strong bull spike up to bar 4. The failed wedge was followed by about a measured move up equal to about the height of the wedge (the bar 6 high to the bar 3 or maybe bar 1 low).

##### 阶梯形态加速为更强趋势

**阶梯形态**可以加速成为更强的趋势（参见图 26.2）。到 K 线 7 时，欧元/美元外汇图表在一个通道中形成了三个更高的高点和低点，因此形成了一个**阶梯型牛市趋势**。

---

##### 通道突破与测量走势

K 线 8 是一根牛市趋势 K 线，突破了通道顶部，随后是一根熊市反转 K 线，但从未触发做空。**突破**应该延伸到大约一个**等幅测量走势**，达到一条平行线，该平行线与中线的距离大约等于中线与底线的距离（即**Andrew's Pitchfork 走势**），而它确实达到了。当**楔形顶部**失败时，这种向上加速是典型的。有三次向上推动，在 K 线 6 结束，但如果你从强劲的牛市飙升至 K 线 4 开始重新计数，你也可以将 K 线 8 之前的小幅摆动高点视为第三次向上推动。失败的楔形之后是大约等于楔形高度（K 线 6 高点到 K 线 3 或 K 线 1 低点）的**等幅测量走势**。

---

>When each breakout is smaller than the previous one, the trend's momentum is waning and a deeper pullback or a reversal might soon follow. Figure 26.3 shows a bull trend stairs pattern with three or more trending higher highs and lows contained in a roughly drawn channel. Bars 4, 6, and 8 formed shrinking stairs, representing loss of bullish momentum and presaging the reversal. The channel functioned like a large bear flag and the bear breakout occurred at bar 9.
>After the bar 9 breakout, there was a lower high breakout pullback to bar 10 that resulted in a stairs bear trend. Bar 10 was a rough double top bear flag with the high of the first pullback in the move down to bar 9.Bar 11 overshot the bear channel to the downside and led to a small two-legged reversal up and the expected penetration of the top of the channel.
>Once the market begins to form stairs down, you can usually fade the close of every strong trend bar breakout for a scalp. Buy every bear trend bar that closes below a prior bear stair for a scalp. Likewise, in bull stairs, you can scalp a short on the close of any trend bar that exceeds the high of the prior stair. In general, though, it is safer to enter on a stop as the market reverses (for example, if the market reverses up from the bottom of the channel, enter on a stop above the prior bar).

##### 动能减弱与趋势反转的预兆

当每次**突破**都比前一次小时，趋势的动能正在减弱，可能很快就会出现更深的回调或反转。图 26.3 显示了一个**牛市阶梯形态**，其中包含三个或更多趋势性的更高高点和低点，被大致绘制在一个通道中。K 线 4、6 和 8 形成了**缩小型阶梯形态**，代表着牛市动能的丧失，预示着反转。该通道就像一个大型熊市旗形，熊市**突破**发生在 K 线 9。

---

##### 突破后的回调与新的趋势

在 K 线 9 突破之后，出现了向 K 线 10 的更低高点**突破回调**，导致了一个**阶梯型熊市趋势**。K 线 10 是一个大致的**双重顶熊市旗形**，与跌至 K 线 9 的走势中第一次回调的高点形成。K 线 11 **过度突破**了熊市通道的下行，导致了一个小的两腿反转上涨，并达到了预期的通道顶部突破。

---

##### 阶梯形态中的剥头皮策略

一旦市场开始形成向下**阶梯形态**，你通常可以在每根强劲趋势 K 线**突破**的收盘时**逆势交易**进行剥头皮。买入每一根收盘价低于先前熊市**阶梯形态**的熊市趋势 K 线进行剥头皮。同样，在牛市**阶梯形态**中，你可以在任何超出先前**阶梯形态**高点的趋势 K 线收盘时做空进行剥头皮。然而，总的来说，在市场反转时以止损入场更安全（例如，如果市场从通道底部反转上涨，则在先前 K 线高点上方止损入场）。
