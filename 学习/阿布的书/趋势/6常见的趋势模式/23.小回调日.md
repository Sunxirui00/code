>Primary characteristics of trend from the open days:
>
>• The low of a bull trend day or the high of a bear trend day is formed within the first few bars of the day.
>• If the opening range of the day is less than 25 percent of the average daily range of recent days, there may be a double bottom on a bull trend day or a double top on a bear trend day (if the opening range is about 50 percent of the average daily range, a breakout is more likely to lead to a trending trading range day).
>• The day may begin with a strong spike lasting many bars or it may have a small opening range.
>• If the market trends from the first bar or so and the initial spike lasts three or more bars,entering on the first pullback is usually good for at least a scalp.• If there is a strong spike on the open that lasts many bars and covers many points, the day will usually become a spike and channel trend day.
>• A large gap opening often leads to a trend from the open day, and the trend can go in either direction. When there is a large gap up and a trend from the open day forms, the day will be a bull trend day about 60 percent of the time and a bear trend day 40 percent of the time. The opposite is true for gap down openings. The larger the gap, the more likely the day will be a trend day and the more likely the trend will be in the direction of the gap.
>• Trend from the open days have urgency and conviction from the outset and are usually the strongest trends and have the smallest pullbacks.
>• Twenty gap bar and moving average gap bar setups come late in the trend.
>• The strongest type of a trend from the open day and the strongest type of trend is one where the opening range is small, and then the day trends relentlessly with small pullbacks all day long. This is a small pullback trend day. For example, the pullbacks in the Emini might be just 10 to 12 ticks (10 to 30 percent of the average daily range). When that is the case, there is usually a pullback in the final couple of hours that is about 150 to 200 percent of the size of the earlier pullbacks, followed by a resumption of the trend into the close.
>• To an experienced trader, the swing setups are 70 percent or more likely to work, even though to they never look that certain to a beginner. Many of the signal bars look bad, as is the case for all strong trends. Most setups appear to have 50 percent or less probability of success.This makes traders not take the trades and forces them to chase the market, or miss the trend completely.
>• There are often many trend bars in the opposite direction, which is a sign of countertrend pressure, and it keeps beginning traders looking for reversals instead of with-trend trades. For example, in a bull trend, there will be many bear trend bars and many two-bar and three-bar bear spikes. Beginners repeatedly short them and lose. The spikes evolve into bull flags that look weak, which discourages beginners from buying them. They just got out of a losing short and are not ready emotionally to risk losing again, especially on a setup that does not look strong. Each bad-looking bull flag is successful, and is followed by another good-looking short setup that fails.
>• The trend is often in a relatively tight channel, and pullbacks often come back and hit breakeven stops, trapping traders out. Traders need to trail their stops below swing lows in a bull trend or above swing highs in a bear trend. If they are too eager to move their stops to breakeven, they will get trapped out.

##### **开盘即趋势日**的主要特征：

- **日内极值形成时间**：牛市**开盘即趋势日**的最低点或熊市**开盘即趋势日**的最高点，在交易日的前几根K线内形成。
    
- **开盘区间与形态**：如果日开盘区间小于近期日平均波动范围的25%，则牛市**开盘即趋势日**可能会出现**双重底**，或熊市**开盘即趋势日**会出现**双重顶**（如果开盘区间约为平均日波动范围的50%，则**突破**更有可能导致**趋势性交易区间日**）。
    
- **起始急涨或小开盘区间**：当天可能以持续多根K线的强劲**急涨**开始，或者开盘区间很小。
    
- **首次回调入场**：如果市场从第一根K线左右开始趋势运行，并且初始**急涨**持续三根或更多K线，那么在第一次回调时入场通常至少可以获得**剥头皮**利润。
    
- **强劲开盘急涨的后续**：如果开盘时有一个强劲的**急涨**，持续多根K线并覆盖大量点位，那么当天通常会成为**急涨通道趋势日**。
    
- **大型跳空与趋势方向**：大型**跳空开盘**通常会导致**开盘即趋势日**，并且趋势可以向任一方向发展。当出现大型**跳空高开**并形成**开盘即趋势日**时，大约60%的时间会是牛市趋势日，40%的时间会是熊市趋势日。**跳空低开**的情况则相反。跳空越大，当天成为趋势日的可能性越大，并且趋势方向越可能与跳空方向一致。
    
- **强劲趋势的特征**：**开盘即趋势日**从一开始就具有紧迫感和信念，通常是**最强劲的趋势**，并且**回调最小**。
    
- **特定交易机会的出现时机**：20**缺口K线**和**移动平均线缺口K线**的“交易机会”在趋势后期出现。
    
- **最强劲的开盘即趋势日类型**：最强劲的**开盘即趋势日**类型和最强劲的趋势是开盘区间很小，然后全天无情地趋势运行，伴随着小幅回调。这是一种**小幅回调趋势日（small pullback trend day）**。例如，Emini的回调可能只有10到12个跳动点（平均日波动范围的10%到30%）。在这种情况下，通常在最后几个小时会有一个回调，其幅度约为之前回调的150%到200%，随后趋势恢复直到收盘。
    
- **熟练交易者的胜率**：对于经验丰富的交易者来说，**波段交易机会**的成功率在70%或更高，尽管对于初学者来说它们从不显得那么确定。许多信号K线看起来很差，所有强劲趋势都是如此。大多数“交易机会”的成功概率看起来只有50%或更低。这使得交易者不进行交易，迫使他们追涨杀跌，或者完全错过趋势。
    
- **反趋势压力与初学者误区**：趋势中经常出现许多反方向的趋势K线，这是反趋势压力的迹象，它使初学者持续寻找反转，而不是顺势交易。例如，在牛市趋势中，会有许多看跌趋势K线，以及许多两K线和三K线看跌**急涨**。初学者反复做空它们并亏损。这些**急涨**演变为看起来很弱的**牛旗**，这阻碍了初学者买入它们。他们刚刚从亏损的空头头寸中出场，情绪上还没有准备好再次冒险亏损，特别是在一个看起来不强的“交易机会”上。每一个看起来很差的**牛旗**都成功了，随后是另一个看起来不错的做空**交易机会**却失败了。
    
- **紧密通道与止损设置**：趋势通常处于一个相对紧密的通道中，回调经常会回撤并触发盈亏平衡止损，将交易者**诱出**。交易者需要将止损跟踪在牛市趋势的摆动低点下方，或熊市趋势的摆动高点上方。如果他们过于急于将止损移至盈亏平衡点，他们就会被**诱出**。
