>Primary characteristics of trend resumption days:
>
>• The day has a strong trend in the first hour or so and then enters a trading range.
>• The trading range lasts for hours and often lulls traders into thinking that the day will be quiet into the close.
>• The trend resumes in the final hour or two.
>• The second leg often is about the same size as the first leg.
>• The protracted trading range is often a very tight trading range.
>• There is often a breakout from the trading range late in the day that tries to reverse the trend, but it is usually a trap. The market then reverses and breaks out in the opposite direction into the close. A trap is more likely when the trading range is unusually tight.
>• There is often a breakout pullback entry for traders who did not enter earlier or on the breakout.

##### **趋势恢复日的主要特征**

**趋势恢复日**（Trend Resumption Day）是市场行为中一种特定模式，其主要特点如下：

- **开盘强势趋势后进入交易区间：** 当天开盘后的一个小时左右会形成一个强劲的趋势，随后市场进入一个**交易区间**。
    
- **长期交易区间：** 这个**交易区间**会持续数小时，经常让交易者误以为当天会平静地收盘。
    
- **尾盘趋势恢复：** 趋势通常在最后的一两个小时内恢复。
    
- **第二“腿”与第一“腿”规模相似：** 恢复后的第二“腿”走势通常与第一“腿”的规模大致相同。
    
- **紧密交易区间：** 长期盘整的**交易区间**通常会非常紧密。
    
- **尾盘突破陷阱：** 当天晚些时候通常会有一个从**交易区间**中突破的尝试，试图反转趋势，但这通常是一个**陷阱**。市场随后会反转并在相反方向上**突破**，直至收盘。当**交易区间**异常紧密时，出现**陷阱**的可能性更大。
    
- **突破回调入场机会：** 对于那些没有在早期或**突破**时入场的交易者来说，通常会有一个**突破回调**的**交易机会**。

>Sometimes there will be a strong trend for the first hour or so and then the market goes sideways for several hours. Whenever this happens and especially if the sideways action is in a very tight trading range, the day is likely becoming a trend resumption day. Don't give up on the boring midday trading range, because there might be a strong trend in the final hour or so.The breakout is usually in the direction of the earlier trend, but sometimes it can be in the opposite direction and turn the day into a reversal day. For example, if the trend from the open was a bear trend, there is usually a late downside breakout from the trading range, and the day often opens near its high and closes near its low. There is frequently a brief one- or two-bar strong reversal breakout that fails between 11 a.m. and noon PST, trapping traders into the wrong (long) direction, and it is usually followed by a breakout in the other direction. This happens quickly, but if you are expecting it, you have a chance of catching a big bear move into the close. Less often, the reversal breakout succeeds and the trend in the final hour, if there is one, can retrace all or part of the opening bear trend.
>The midday sideways action does not have to be a tight trading range, and it often has tradable legs in both directions. Sometimes there are three countertrend lazy pushes, creating a wedge flag. At other times the third leg fails to surpass the second, and this forms a head and shoulders flag (most head and shoulders reversal patterns fail and become continuation patterns). Because the pattern often has three pushes instead of two, it traps traders out of their positions from the open, thinking that this countertrend action might in fact be a new,opposite trend. However, don't let yourself get trapped out, and be ready to enter when you see a good setup that will get you into the market in the same direction as the morning trend.Traders are scaling into positions in both directions and, at some point, many reach their maximum size. Once there is a breakout, the losing side cannot scale in anymore, and their only choices are hope and getting stopped out. For example, if there is a strong morning bear trend and then the market goes sideways, both the bulls and the bears will continue to add to their positions during the trading range over the next several hours, and many will reach the maximum size that they are willing to hold. Once the market begins to break to the downside,the bulls can no longer continue to buy. With a lot of bulls no longer able to buy, the bears are unopposed. As the market falls, it will often accelerate as more and more bulls give up and sell out of their losing longs, adding to the collapse into the close. The difficult part of this type of day is that the quiet midday sideways movement often leads traders to give up on the day when in fact they should view this as an opportunity. Just be ready to enter. The best forms of this pattern occur only a couple of times a month.
>Instead of a midday trading range, the market will sometimes form a weakly trending countertrend move for a couple of hours, leaving traders wondering if the day is a reversal day instead of a trend resumption day. What might be developing is a weak trend resumption day,one that feels more like a trading range day but ends up opening on one extreme and closing on the other. Watch for the trend of the open to resume in the final hour, and be prepared to enter. For example, if there was a strong sell-off on the open, and then a lower-momentum rally with three pushes up that retraces some or even all of the initial sell-off, be prepared for a break below that bull channel and a resumption of the bear trend into the close. If there is a breakout of the top of the bull channel that reverses back down, this can be a good swing short entry for the trend into the close. Instead, there might be a setup that looks like a good low-risk short on the breakout below the channel. Otherwise, you can wait for the bear trend to resume and then look to enter on a breakout pullback or a pullback near the moving average. Even though the 5 minute chart might look like a trading range, maybe like an ABC on a higher time frame chart, if the market closes near the low, the day will create a bear trend bar on the daily chart.
>Trend resumption patterns often take place over two or more days. Although the 5 minute chart might look like it has huge swings during those days, they may create a simple ABC on the 60 minute chart. For example, if yesterday had a strong bull spike for a couple of hours and then entered a trading range and that trading range continued for a couple of hours today, yesterday's trend might resume at any point. If you are aware of this, you will be more likely to be willing to swing a larger part of your position for what could be a big move.

##### **趋势恢复日的特点与交易策略**

有时，市场会在开盘后的一个小时左右形成强劲趋势，然后横向盘整数小时。无论何时发生这种情况，特别是当横向走势出现在一个非常紧密的**交易区间**内时，当天很可能会演变为**趋势恢复日**。不要放弃这种沉闷的午盘**交易区间**，因为在最后的一个小时左右可能会出现强劲趋势。

---

##### **尾盘突破的方向与陷阱**

尾盘的**突破**通常会与早期趋势方向一致，但有时也可能向相反方向发展，将当天转变为**反转日**。例如，如果**开盘即趋势**是熊市趋势，通常会在**交易区间**的尾盘出现向下**突破**，并且当天通常开盘接近高点，收盘接近低点。

在太平洋时间上午11点到中午之间，经常会出现一次短暂的一到两K线强劲**反转突破**的失败，将交易者困入错误（多头）方向，随后通常会出现另一个方向的**突破**。这种情况发生得很快，但如果您有所预期，就有机会抓住一个巨大的熊市走势直到收盘。

---

##### **趋势恢复或反转日**

较少情况下，**反转突破**会成功，并且最后几个小时的趋势（如果存在的话）可能会回撤全部或部分开盘时的熊市趋势。

午盘的横向走势不一定是一个紧密的**交易区间**，它通常在两个方向上都有可交易的“腿”。有时会出现三次逆势的“懒惰”推动，形成**楔形旗形**。另一些时候，第三“腿”未能超越第二“腿”，这形成了**头肩形旗形**（大多数**头肩形反转形态**都会失败，并成为**持续形态**）。由于这种形态通常有三次推动而不是两次，它会将交易者从开盘时的头寸中困出，让他们认为这种逆势行为可能实际上是一个新的、相反的趋势。然而，不要让自己被困出，并准备好在看到一个好的**交易机会**时入场，它会让你朝着与上午趋势相同的方向进入市场。

---

##### **多空力量的积聚与突破加速**

交易者会不断**分批加仓**多空双方的头寸，在某个时刻，许多人会达到他们的最大仓位。一旦出现**突破**，亏损方就无法再**分批加仓**，他们唯一的选择就是寄希望或者被止损。

例如，如果上午出现强劲的熊市趋势，然后市场横向盘整，那么多头和空头都会在接下来的几个小时的**交易区间**内继续增加头寸，许多人会达到他们愿意持有的最大仓位。一旦市场开始向下突破，多头就无法继续买入。由于大量多头无法再买入，空头没有对手。随着市场下跌，它通常会加速，因为越来越多的多头放弃并卖出他们的亏损多头头寸，从而加剧了收盘前的崩盘。

---

##### **午盘盘整的交易价值**

这种日子最困难的部分是，平静的午盘横向走势常常导致交易者放弃当天交易，而实际上他们应该将此视为一个机会。只需做好入场准备。这种形态的最佳形式每月只出现几次。

---

##### **弱势趋势恢复日与高时间框架视角**

有时，市场不会形成午盘**交易区间**，而是形成一个持续数小时的弱势逆势走势，让交易者怀疑当天是**反转日**而不是**趋势恢复日**。这可能正在发展成为一个弱势**趋势恢复日**，一个感觉更像**交易区间日**，但最终在一端开盘并在另一端收盘的日子。

---

##### **尾盘趋势恢复的信号**

关注开盘趋势在最后几个小时的恢复，并做好入场准备。例如，如果开盘时出现强劲抛售，然后是一个低动量、有三次向上推动的反弹，回撤了部分甚至全部初始抛售，请准备好在那个牛市通道下方**突破**，并恢复熊市趋势直到收盘。如果牛市通道顶部出现一个**突破**并反转回落，这可能是趋势到收盘的一个很好的**波段做空入场机会**。

---

##### **通道突破后的交易机会**

相反，可能会有一个看起来风险很低的做空**交易机会**，即在通道下方**突破**。否则，您可以等待熊市趋势恢复，然后寻找**突破回调**或**移动平均线**附近的回调入场。尽管5分钟图可能看起来像一个**交易区间**，也许在更高时间框架图表上像一个ABC形态，但如果市场收盘接近低点，当天会在日线图上形成一根**熊市趋势K线**。

---

##### **跨日趋势恢复与长期持有**

**趋势恢复形态**通常会持续两天或更长时间。尽管5分钟图可能显示这些天内出现巨大的波动，但它们在60分钟图上可能只形成一个简单的ABC形态。例如，如果昨天有两小时的强劲**牛市急涨**，然后进入**交易区间**，并且这个**交易区间**今天继续持续了几个小时，那么昨天的趋势可能随时恢复。如果您意识到这一点，您将更有可能愿意**波段交易**更大一部分头寸，以应对可能出现的大幅波动。

---

>On big gap days, the market often tests the open before the trend begins. In Figure 25.1, the market opened with a large gap up and then had a double bottom test of the low followed by a big rally up to bar 3. From there, it traded in a tight range for more than three hours, lulling traders into thinking that the good trading was done. Bar 6 reversed up from a poke below a bear trend channel line and it also dipped one tick below the bar 4 signal bar high. This trapped some bears into a short and many bulls out of their longs. The signal bar for the rally into the close was the first moving average gap bar of the day.
>There were several other chances to get long, like the reversal up from the failed breakouts below micro trend lines at bars 7, 9, and 10.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In Figure 25.1, bar 7 was a high 2 entry and a reversal up from a one-tick break of a small bull trend line. Bar 1 was the high 1 entry.
>Bar 8 was a high 2 variant (bear-bull-bear bars: the bar after bar 7 had a bear body and therefore the first push down, the next bar had a bull body and therefore traded up, and then the following bar had a bear body again, for a second push down).

##### 跳空开盘与趋势前的测试

在大幅跳空开盘的日子里，市场在趋势开始前通常会测试开盘价。在图 25.1 中，市场大幅跳空高开，然后对低点进行了**双重底测试**，随后大幅反弹至 K 线 3。从那时起，市场在一个紧密区间内交易了三个多小时，让交易者误以为良好的交易已经结束。K 线 6 从熊市趋势通道线下方短暂跌破后反转上涨，并且也跌破 K 线 4 信号 K 线高点一个刻度。这**困住了**一些做空的空头，也让许多多头错过了做多机会。反弹至收盘的信号 K 线是当天第一次**移动平均线缺口 K 线**。

---

##### 额外的做多机会与深入探讨

还有其他几次做多机会，例如在 K 线 7、9 和 10 处，市场从微趋势线下方**失败突破**后反转上涨。

---

##### 图表深入探讨：入场点与形态

在图 25.1 中，K 线 7 是一个**高 2 入场机会**，也是从小型牛市趋势线短暂跌破一个刻度后反转上涨。K 线 1 是**高 1 入场机会**。

K 线 8 是一个**高 2 变体**（熊-牛-熊 K 线：K 线 7 之后的 K 线是熊市实体，因此是第一次向下推动；下一根 K 线是牛市实体，因此上涨；然后随后的 K 线再次是熊市实体，形成第二次向下推动）。

>Sometimes a tight trading range that follows a strong trend can lead to a reversal instead of trend resumption. In Figure 25.2, today had a strong sell-off from bar 3 and then entered a tight trading range for a few hours. This often leads to a bear trend resumption into the close with the final sell-off often being as large as the initial one. There is frequently a failed breakout of the top of the range before the final bear leg begins. Bar 12 was a perfect setup for a swing short because it was a bear reversal bar that broke out of the top of the tight trading range late in the day. However, instead of the next bar being an entry bar for a large bear move, it was a small bull inside bar, and therefore a breakout pullback long setup. Bar 12broke out and this inside bar was a pause, which is a type of pullback.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In Figure 25.2, the day opened with a large gap down and a strong bull reversal bar, setting up a failed breakout long and a possible trend from the open bull day.
>Bars 13 and 14 were large bull trend bars that formed a two-bar breakout. Any breakout often is followed by a measured move based on the spike. It is usually based on the height from the open or low of the first bar of the spike to the close or high of the final bar. The closing high of the day was at a measured move from the open of bar 13 to the high of bar 14.
>Most trend resumption bear days do not have a large rally on the open, and that large rally is an indication that the bulls were willing to buy aggressively today. Even though the middle of the day was setting up perfectly for a big sell-off into the close, you can never be certain and there is always about a 40 percent chance that the exact opposite can happen. Another clue that the market might rally to test the open of the day was that the low of the day was almost a perfect measured move down from the open of the day to the top of the initial rally. That means that the open of the day was in the middle of the day's range. If the market could get back up there, the day could be close to a doji day, which is fairly common. Notice how the market repeatedly tested the support line at the bar 7 low to the tick and continued to find buyers. There were double bottom pullback long setups at the inside bar after bar 8, the inside bar after bar 9, and the higher lows at bars 9 and 11.
>The support line was one tick below the initial bar 5 entry bar for the expected pullback from the sell climax. Bar 5 was the entry bar above the two-bar reversal setup at the low of the day.The market ran the stops below that entry bar by one tick, but, despite many attempts, it could not go any further down. This is a sign of strong bulls at work. Both buy and sell programs continued throughout the tight trading range, but eventually the buy programs overwhelmed the sell programs. All of those shorts had to be bought back, and this added to the buying pressure. Also, many sell programs reversed to buy programs, adding to the buying. The bars 14 and 15 spike up was followed by a channel into the close.

##### 强劲趋势后的紧密交易区间：反转与趋势延续的抉择

有时，强劲趋势之后的紧密交易区间可能导致**反转**而非**趋势恢复**。在图 25.2 中，当天从 K 线 3 开始出现强劲抛售，随后进入了数小时的紧密交易区间。这通常会导致熊市趋势恢复至收盘，最终的抛售幅度通常与最初的抛售相当。在最终熊市腿开始之前，通常会出现对区间顶部的**失败突破**。K 线 12 是一个完美的**波段做空交易机会**，因为它是一根熊市反转 K 线，在当天晚些时候突破了紧密交易区间的顶部。然而，下一根 K 线并非预示着大幅熊市走势的入场 K 线，而是一根小型牛市内包线，因此它成为了一个**突破回调多头交易机会**。K 线 12 发生了突破，而这根内包线是暂停，这是一种回调。

---

##### 图表深入探讨：开盘跳空与价格行为线索

在图 25.2 中，当天以大幅跳空低开和一根强劲的牛市反转 K 线开盘，设置了一个**失败突破多头交易机会**和可能的“开盘即趋势”牛市日。

K 线 13 和 14 是形成两 K 线突破的大型牛市趋势 K 线。任何突破之后通常都会出现基于飙升的**等幅测量走势**。这通常基于飙升第一根 K 线的开盘价或低点到最后一根 K 线的收盘价或高点的高度。当日的收盘高点是 K 线 13 开盘价到 K 线 14 高点的**等幅测量走势**。

大多数熊市趋势恢复日不会在开盘时出现大幅反弹，而这种大幅反弹表明多头今天愿意积极买入。尽管当天中午的市场走势完美地预示着尾盘的大幅抛售，但你永远无法确定，并且总有大约 40% 的可能性会发生完全相反的情况。另一个暗示市场可能反弹测试当日开盘价的线索是，当日低点几乎完美地完成了从当日开盘价到最初反弹顶部的**等幅测量走势**。这意味着当日开盘价位于当日区间的中部。如果市场能够回到那里，当天可能会接近十字星日，这种情况相当常见。

注意市场如何反复测试 K 线 7 低点处的支撑线到精确的跳动点，并继续找到买家。在 K 线 8 之后的内包线、K 线 9 之后的内包线以及 K 线 9 和 11 的更高低点处，都有**双重底回调多头交易机会**。

支撑线在最初 K 线 5 入场 K 线下方一个跳动点，这是预期从**卖出高潮**回调的入场 K 线。K 线 5 是在当日低点两 K 线反转**交易机会**之上的入场 K 线。市场“扫掉”了该入场 K 线下方一个跳动点的止损，但尽管多次尝试，它无法进一步下跌。这是强劲多头正在行动的迹象。买入和卖出程序在整个紧密交易区间内持续进行，但最终买入程序压倒了卖出程序。所有那些空头都不得不被回购，这增加了买入压力。此外，许多卖出程序反转为买入程序，增加了买盘。K 线 14 和 15 的向上飙升之后是一个通道，直到收盘。

---

>Even though the initial rally may only have a couple of strong trend bars and appear to be leading to a trading range day, the trend resumption can still be strong. In Figure 25.3, the market started as a trend from the open bull trend when it rallied from an expanding triangle bottom and a failed breakout of yesterday's low. It then ran for two bars, but it stalled in the middle of yesterday's trading range. A rally from any three-push pattern usually results in at least two legs up, which ultimately developed here. Bar 2 was a breakout pullback that led to another small rally, but then the market lost momentum. It continued to weakly trend above the moving average until bar 3. At this point, it was clear that something was not right. A trend from the open bull trend is one of the strongest forms of trends but this was clearly not trending strongly. That meant that traders would soon decide that the day was not what they thought and they would exit and wait. They would then be looking for a trading range day and a possible new low for the day. It was possible for the bar 2 low to be followed by a double bottom bull flag, but, in the absence of strong early bulls, bears would aggressively push for a new low of the day and the bar 2 low would likely fail. Bar 4 was a second small push below bar 2 and it was followed by a trend into the close, creating a trend resumption bull day, albeit a weak one, and giving the expected second leg up from the expanding triangle bottom. Bar 4was an exact breakout test of the trend from the open signal bar high.

![[Pasted image 20250711171234.png]]
##### 初始反弹与趋势恢复的判断

即使最初的反弹可能只有几根强劲的趋势 K 线，并且看起来正导向一个交易区间日，但**趋势恢复**仍然可能强劲。在图 25.3 中，市场最初是从开盘牛市趋势开始的，当时它从一个**扩张三角形底部**和昨日低点的**失败突破**中反弹。随后它运行了两根 K 线，但在昨日交易区间的中间停滞不前。任何三推模式的反弹通常会导致至少两腿上涨，最终在这里也得到了发展。K 线 2 是一个**突破回调**，导致了另一次小幅反弹，但随后市场失去了动能。它继续在移动平均线上方疲软地趋势运行，直到 K 线 3。

---

##### 趋势动能的转变与日内预期

此时，很明显有些不对劲。开盘牛市趋势是趋势中最强劲的形式之一，但这显然没有强劲地趋势运行。这意味着交易者很快就会认为当天并非他们所想，他们会出场并等待。然后他们会寻找**交易区间日**和当日可能的新低。K 线 2 低点之后有可能出现**双重底牛市旗形**，但在缺乏强劲早期多头的情况下，空头会积极推动当日新低，K 线 2 低点很可能会失败。K 线 4 是K 线 2 下方的第二次小幅推动，随后趋势运行至收盘，形成一个**趋势恢复牛市日**，尽管是一个疲软的趋势日，并给出了扩张三角形底部的预期第二腿上涨。K 线 4 是对开盘信号 K 线高点的精确**突破测试**。

---


>Trend resumption can take place over the course of several days. In Figure 25.4, the market had a strong move down to bar 2 and then entered a trading range that lasted two and a half days. Trading ranges can last a long time, but usually break out in the direction of the trend.The bear trend resumed and had a second leg down from bar 5 to bar 14, five days after the first move down.
>The bear leg down from bar 5 to bar 6 was followed by a trading range, and the second leg down ended on the open of the next day at bar 9.The sell-off from bar 7 to bar 9 was followed by a trading range to bar 13, and the bear trend resumption occurred with the move down to bar 14. This was a three-day trend resumption pattern.

![[Pasted image 20250711171307.png]]

---

##### 跨日趋势恢复的现象

趋势恢复可能需要几天时间才能完成。在图 25.4 中，市场从 K 线 2 强劲下跌，随后进入了一个持续两天半的交易区间。交易区间可以持续很长时间，但通常会**向趋势方向突破**。熊市趋势恢复，并在第一次下跌五天后，从 K 线 5 到 K 线 14 形成了第二腿下跌。

---

##### 熊市腿与随后的交易区间

从 K 线 5 到 K 线 6 的熊市腿之后是一个交易区间，第二腿下跌在第二天开盘时于 K 线 9 结束。从 K 线 7 到 K 线 9 的抛售之后是一个交易区间，直到 K 线 13，熊市趋势的恢复发生在跌至 K 线 14 的走势中。这是一个为期三天的**趋势恢复模式**。

---
