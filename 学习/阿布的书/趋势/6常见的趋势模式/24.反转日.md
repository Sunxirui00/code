>Primary characteristics of reversal days:
>
>• The day trends in one direction and then it trends in the opposite direction into the close.
>• Most start as trending trading range days.
>• If the reversal starts in the last couple of hours and is strong, it will usually have follow-through on the next day and often the next several days.
##### **反转日**的主要特征：

- **先趋势后反转**：当天先朝一个方向运行趋势，然后反向趋势运行直至收盘。
- **起始模式**：大多数**反转日**都始于**趋势性交易区间日**。
- **尾盘强劲反转的后续**：如果反转发生在最后几个小时并且非常强劲，通常会在第二天，甚至接下来的几天内出现**跟进动量**。

>Some of the strongest trends begin in the middle or end of the day. Sometimes they originate as trading range breakouts or climactic trend reversals, usually attributed to some news item,but this is unimportant. In either case, the market can enter a runaway trend mode where it trends relentlessly with only minor pullbacks. There are large trend bars with little overlap and mostly small tails. This is a breakout and a clear always-in flip. You must enter quickly,even if the new trend looks climactic and overdone (and it is, but it will likely continue to get much more so!), and swing most of your position. You should trade these breakout spikes aggressively and make sure that you have at least a small position because the move can go very far. Trading strong spikes is described in detail in the section on breakouts in book 2, and reversals are discussed in detail in book 3.
>At other times, the market is trending and then begins a pullback, but the pull-back just grows endlessly and becomes a trend channel in the opposite direction. There is almost always at least one countertrend spike before the channel begins, so whenever you see a pullback that has a strong countertrend spike, be aware that the trend might be reversing. For example, if the market has a strong sell-off for the first hour or two and you think there might be a two-legged rally to the moving average,but that pullback begins with a fairly strong bull trend bar, make sure to consider the possibility that the bar could be a bull spike that could be followed by a relentless bull channel instead of a small bear flag. By the end of the day, the pullback can grow larger than the bear trend that preceded it, and the day could become a bull reversal bar on the daily chart. If you recognize this behavior early, you should restrict your trading to buying only,because you will lose money on shorts as you desperately hope that the bear trend from the first hour resumes. Many of these days can be classified as other types of trend days, and they are commonly trending trading range days. In fact, most reversal days begin as trending trading range days. The opposite is true for bear trends on the open that reverse into relentless bear channels.


>A strong trend can start at any time during the day, even if the day initially had a strong trend in the opposite direction. As shown in Figure 24.1, there was a sharp two-legged move up in the first hour, followed by a tight channel pullback to test the moving average. The market then went sideways for over two hours and finally broke down at bar 9 into a lower range. The last profitable long entry was at 8:50 a.m. PST at bar 5. If you continued to take long scalps,you would eventually realize that you were losing on every trade, which is a sure sign that the market is trending in the wrong direction and either you didn't see it or you didn't believe it.
>Pullbacks happen when bulls take profits. Why do traders ever take profits when a trend is strong? Because no matter how strong a trend is, it can have a deep pullback that would allow traders to enter again at a much better price, and sometimes the trend can reverse. If they did not take at least partial profits, they would then watch their big profit disappear and even turn into a loss.

>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The market in Figure 24.1 broke out above the trading range of the final hour of yesterday. The large tail on top of the first bar indicates that sellers were reasonably strongand therefore buying above it was risky. The market rallied for six bars and reversed down hard during bar 2, presumably on a 7:00 a.m. report. After the bull momentum leading up to the report and no sign of a top or a buy climax, it was not good to short below the top bar of this rally. This was the first pullback in a trend from the open bull trend and is a buy setup.However, the strength of the bar 2 bear spike was unusual if the day was to become a bull trend day.
>The bar 3 low (the bottom of bar 2) formed a possible double bottom with the bar 1 low. It is common for a gap up day to have a pullback that tests the low of the open and then to become a bull trend day. Since the opening range was greater than about 30 percent of the average range of recent days, the opening range was not a good breakout mode setup. The likelihood of a strong, relentless trend after a bull breakout was less. If the market was to become a bull trend day, it would more likely be a weaker version, perhaps like a trending trading range day. The bull ii setup after bar 3 was a good signal for a long, but since a strong bull trend was unlikely, bulls should take at least half off after about two to four points' profit.It is also possible that the bar 3 strong bear spike could be followed by a bear channel after a pullback. Here, the pullback was to a higher high at bar 4, which followed buy climax bars on the bar before and two bars before that. Consecutive buy climaxes usually lead to at least a two-legged correction lasting about 10 bars. Since this was not a clear bull trend day and it had strong selling at bar 3, this bear reversal bar was an acceptable low 2 short setup.
>The pullback to bar 5 broke the bull trend line, and the bar 6 lower high set the stage for a bear trend day into the close. Bar 6 was the first bar of a two-bar bear spike, which alerted traders to the possibility that a channel down might follow. The bar before bar 5 was a bear spike, as was the very large bar 3 bear trend bar. There were other bear spikes as the bear channel progressed, and the market could not close above the moving average after the bar before bar 8.
>As with most strong trend channels, you would make more by swinging than by scalping because there are frequent pullbacks that would run stops on even the with-trend scalps (like the shorts from bars 8 and 10), resulting in losses. It is better to trail your stop above the prior swing high.
>The bar 9 spike down that broke below the upper trading range was followed by a perfect measured move into the close. Bar 9 was a breakaway gap, the gap being between the bottom of the upper range and the bar 10 breakout pullback. The middle of that gap was the middle of the move down from bar 4 to the lowjust before the close of the day.
>On the daily chart, this would be a doji bar with a small body and a large tail at the top, and if it is in the area on the chart where a bear reversal is likely, it can be a good signal bar for a short trade on the daily chart.
>Notice that the market was forming lower highs and lows between bars 5 and 9, hinting that a bear trend might be underway.

>Most reversal days begin as trending trading range days as shown in Figure 24.2, and this day was also a spike and channel bear trend day and a trend from the open bear day. It reversed up after three pushes down (bars 8, 15, and 17) into a bull reversal day that trended up into the close. This is a common occurrence in trending trading range days.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>A large gap opening often is followed by a trend in either direction, and since the first bar of the day in Figure 24.2 was a strong bear trend bar, the odds of a bear trend were greater. This is a failed breakout setup, and traders would short below its low for a possible trend from the open bear day.
>Bars 4 and 5 were large bear trend bars and therefore bear spikes and sell climaxes. A pair of consecutive climaxes is usually followed by at least a several-bar pause or pull-back, as happened here (a pullback to the bar 7 high). Bar 7 was then a third sell climax, and a third consecutive sell climax is usually followed by an even larger correction. The move down to bar 8 was a spike and climax type of bear trend, and it was followed by a rally to bar 1 0 that tested the bar 7 start of the channel down to bar 8. This formed a double top bear flag, and ultimately an approximate measured move down to the lowof the day. The entire move down to bar 8 was in a tight channel and was therefore a larger spike.
>After a large wedge bottom, the market usually has at least a two-legged rally that tests the top of the wedge (here, the bar 10 high), and the number of bars in the correction is usually at least a third or so of the number of bars in the wedge. This large wedge was also the bear channel that followed the bear spike from bar 4 to bar 8, and that was also a reason for the test of the bar 1 0 high (the beginning of a channel usually gets tested). The test may break above that high but more often forms a double top bear flag, as it did here.
>When there is a wedge reversal, it is usually safer to buy after a higher low like at bar 1 9 or above the bar 22 failed low 2. You can see the large bull spike entry bar there, and it was a sign that traders believed that the rally was no longer just a bear flag and the market could have a measured move up and trade into the upper trading range. This was a complex day, and the wedge reversal could also be thought of as the bottom of a lower trading range on a trending trading range day. If enough traders believed that was the case, buying the first entry above the inside bar after bar 17 was reasonable, with the expectation of a test of the bottom of the upper trading range.
>Bars 11, 13, and 14 formed a wedge bull flag, but the market broke to the downside instead of reversing up. When that happens, the market usually falls to about a measured move down from the top to the bottom of the wedge. Bar 1 0 was the top of the wedge, and the move down to bar 15 exceeded the measured move objective. When that happens, there is usually another leg down after a pullback, as was the case here.
>Although the move up to bar 18 had two legs, this rally had too few bars to adequately correct that large wedge bottom. Also, it was in a tight channel and was therefore likely just the first of two or more legs up. There was a second leg up to bar 20, but the problem was the same. The move from bar 17 up to bar 20 had too few bars to correct such a large wedge and it was still in a relatively tight channel. This creates uncertainty and increases the odds that the market will need a larger second leg up to convince traders that the wedge was adequately corrected.
>The move from bar 21 to bar 25 might be good enough to satisfy traders that an adequate two-legged correction was complete, but the market then broke out to the upside in a three-bar bull spike up to bar 27. Since the bears could not generate much of a downside breakout in the channel from bar 17 to bar 25, no clear two-legged move ever developed. This absence of any clear pullback after a first leg up was a sign of strength by the bulls.

>In a runaway bull trend, there are more chances to buy on the 3 minute chart than on the 5minute chart (see Figure 24.3). Bars 1 and 2 were small countertrend inside bars on the 3minute chart on the left, setting up high 1 longs, but they were not clear signals on the 5minute chart. The bar 3 long was present on both charts (on the 5 minute chart, it was a high 1long in a strong bull spike, even though it had a bear body).
