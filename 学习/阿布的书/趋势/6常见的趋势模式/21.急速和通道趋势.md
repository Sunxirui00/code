>Primary characteristics of spike and channel trend days:• There is a spike that is made up of one or more trend bars, and it signals that the market is breaking into a clear always-in situation. During the spike, there is a sense of urgency and traders add to their position as they press the trade. The spike is effectively a breakaway gap (discussed in book 2).• The spike usually forms in the first hour and often within the first few bars of the day.• The stronger the breakout, the more likely there will be follow-through in the form of a channel, and the more likely the channel will go far (see the sections on the strength of trends in Chapter 19, and the strength of breakouts in Chapter 2 of book 2).• When the breakout is strong, it is often the basis for a measured move where the channel may end and you can ultimately take partial or complete profits.• Immediately after the spike, there is a pullback that can be as short as a single bar or as long as a couple of dozen bars.• The trend resumes in the form of a channel. During the channel, there is a sense of worry and uncertainty, due to the two-sided trading.• When the market is channeling, it is better to trade it like a trending trading range (for example, in a bull channel, it is better to buy below the low of the prior bar and hold part of the trade for a swing, and if you take any shorts, sell above swing highs or the highs of prior bars and primarily scalp).• The channel will rarely break out in the with-trend direction, but when it does, the breakout usually fails within five bars and then the market reverses.• The channel ends at some measured move target, and often on a third push.• If the channel breaks out against the trend, as it usually ultimately does, don't enter on the breakout and instead wait for the pullback (for example, if there is a bull spike and channel and the market breaks below the channel, look to short a lower high).• The market usually corrects to the start of the channel, which is a test of the gap (the spike,like all spikes, is a gap).• The market then reverses back at least 25 percent in the direction of the trend as it attempts to form a trading range. In a bull spike and channel, the pullback often forms a double bottom bull flag with the bottom of the channel, which is the bottom of the pullback that followed the spike up.• When it is weaker, it is probably more likely a trending trading range day (discussed in the next chapter).


>The spike and channel trend is the most common type of trend and is present in some form almost every day and in every trend. There are countless variations and there are often many smaller ones nested inside larger ones. Because it often is the controlling force over so much price action, it is imperative that traders understand it. It is a pattern with two components.Every trend has both a spike phase and a channel phase, and every trend is in either of those two modes at all times. First, there is a spike of one or more bars where the market is moving quickly. There is a sense of urgency and everyone believes that the market has further to go.The spike is a breakaway gap where the market quickly moves from one price level to another.Next, there is a pullback, which can be as short as a single bar or can last dozens of bars and even retrace beyond the start of the spike. For example, if there is a bull spike, occasionally the pullback will fall below the bottom of the spike, and then the channel begins. After the pullback, the trend converts into a channel, where there is less urgency and more a sense of worry and uncertainty. This is the wall of worry that you sometimes hear pundits mention on TV. Everyone sees two-sided trading taking place and the trend constantly looks like it is about to end, yet it keeps extending. Traders are quick to take profits, but as the trend continues, they keep reentering or adding to their positions because they are not certain when the trend will end and they want to make sure to participate. Rarely, there will be a second spike phase and then another channel, but usually the second spike becomes a failed breakout and is followed by a correction. For example, if there is a bull spike and then a lower-momentum bull channel, the market can break out of the top of the channel with another bull spike. Rarely, it will be followed by another bull channel, but more often the spike becomes a failed breakout and the market then corrects down.


>When the market has a series of bars that cover a lot of points with little or no pulling back,this strong trend is a spike. The spike can be one trend bar, a series of trend bars with little overlap, or sometimes even a very tight channel. In fact, a spike on a given time frame is a steep, tight channel on a smaller time frame. Likewise, steep, tight channels are spikes on higher time frames. The spike ends at the first pause or pullback, but if it resumes within a bar or two, it becomes either a second spike or a spike on a larger time frame. The spike can be as small as a single moderate-sized trend bar or it can last for 10 or more bars. Spikes, climaxes,and breakouts should be thought of as being the same, and they are discussed more in the chapter on breakouts in book 2. In a spike up, everyone is in agreement that this is not an area of value for the bears and therefore the market needs to go up further to find prices where both the bulls and bears are willing to trade. The market will continue to quickly move higheruntil the bulls are willing to take some profits and are less willing to buy new positions, and the bears are beginning to short. This causes a pause or a pullback, and it is the first sign of significant two-sided trading. The opposite is true for a spike down.


>Almost all trends begin with a spike, even if it is a single trend bar and not recognizable as the start of the trend until many bars later. Therefore, almost all trends are variations of a spike and channel trend. However, when the trend has more characteristics of one of the other types of trends discussed in this chapter, you should trade it as that other type to maximize your chances of success.


>By definition, the spike ends immediately before the first pause bar or pullback because it is the pause that signifies the end of the spike. The market can then go on to do any of the obvious three things: the trend can resume, the market can enter a trading range, or the trend can reverse. The first possibility is the most common. The market pulls back for a couple of bars, or maybe a dozen bars, and then the trend resumes. This pullback is a gap test (remember, the spike is a gap) and the start of the channel. When the trend resumes, it is usually less strong as indicated by more overlapping bars, a flatter slope, some pullbacks, and some trend bars in the opposite direction. This is a channel, and the pattern then becomes a spike and channel trend.


>The second possibility occurs if the pullback extends for more than 10 bars. It will then have grown into a trading range, which can break out in either direction. In general, the odds always favor the trading range breakout to be in the same direction as the original trend. If the trading range lasts for a long time, it is simply a flag on a higher time frame chart (for example,a three-day-long trading range on the 5 minute chart that follows a bull spike will usually be just a bull flag on the 60 minute chart, and the odds favor an upside breakout). This is a trend resumption situation and is discussed later in this chapter. Although the trend usually resumes before the end of the day and the day becomes a trend resumption trend day, the breakout from the trading range can sometimes fail or reverse within a few bars (final flag reversals are discussed in book 3 in the chapter on reversals). Rarely, the trading range lasts for several hours or even several days and has very small swings (this is a tight trading range and is discussed in book 2 on trading ranges). As with any trading range, the breakout can be in either direction but is slightly more likely to be in the direction of the trend.


>The third possibility is that the market reverses. As long as the pullback from the spike is not strong enough to flip the always-in trade to the opposite direction, the market will likely continue the trend, and the continuation will almost always be in the form of a channel. Less often, the market will reverse and form a spike in the opposite direction. When this happens,the market will then usually enter a trading range as the bulls and bears fight for follow-through. The bulls will keep buying as they try to create a bull channel to follow their bull spike, and the bears will keep selling as they try to create a bear channel to follow their bear spike. Although the trading range can last for the rest of the day, one side usually wins and the market breaks out. At that point, either it forms a channel and the day becomes a spike and channel trend day or the breakout is soon followed by another trading range and the market forms a trending trading range day, which is discussed in the next chapter.


>Besides reversing with a spike in the opposite direction, the market can also reverse if a trading range forms after the spike. For example, if there is a bull spike and then a trading range, in about a third of cases the market will break out of the bottom of the trading range instead of the top. The breakout can be by a sharp, large bear spike, but more often it is by an unremarkable bear trend bar that is followed by a bear channel.


>If it forms a channel, it is better to trade it only in the direction of the trend. Sometimes there are large swings in the channel, which can provide countertrend scalping opportunities as the channel progresses. Be aware that channels can last much longer than you might imagine and they are always looking like they are reversing. There are many pullbacks along the way,trapping traders into the wrong direction. There are usually many bars with tails, many trend bars in the opposite direction, and lots of overlapping bars, but it is still a trend and it is very costly to trade countertrend prematurely.


>Some days have an early strong momentum move (a spike) and then the trend continues in a less steep channel for the rest of the day. However, the channel sometimes accelerates and follows a parabolic curve instead of a linear path. At other times, it loses momentum and forms a flatter curve. Regardless, the start of the channel is usually tested later in the day or in the next day or two, and the test can then be followed by a trading range or a trend in either direction. The important thing to realize is that if the channel is fairly tight, it is tradable only in the with-trend direction because the pullbacks will not go far enough for a countertrend trade to be profitable. Much less often, the channel has broad swings and is tradable in both directions.


>You should be prepared to look for entries in the countertrend direction after there is a breakout from the channel against the trend, since there is a good chance that the countertrend move will extend all the way back to test the start of the channel and attempt to form a trading range. Remember that a channel, no matter how steep, is a flag in the opposite direction. A bull channel is a bear flag and a bear channel is a bull flag. Also, even though a channel is a sloping trading range, it is also the first leg of a larger trading range, and the reversal is usually to the area around the start of the channel. For example, if there is a spike up, then a pullback, and then a bull channel, the bull channel is usually the first leg of a trading range that has yet to unfold. The market will usually correct down to the bottom of the channel, where it will try to form a double bottom bull flag with the bottom of the channel.This usually leads to a bounce, which is the third leg of the developing trading range. After the bounce, traders should begin to look for other patterns because the predictability of the spike and channel pattern at this point has ended. A spike is a breakout, which means that there will be a gap between the breakout point and the first pullback, which is the start of the channel.The test to the bottom of the channel is a test of the gap and is a breakout test.


>Stock traders often describe the end of a bull channel as a crowded trade because they believe that anyone interested in the stock has gone long and there is no one left to buy. They then expect a fast sell-off down to the start of the channel as all of the channel buyers exit. As the stock quickly falls, they think of the bear leg as being caused by all of the late-entering bulls with open losses quickly exiting to minimize those losses. That rush to the exits by the crowd of bulls leads to the rapidity and depth of the sell-off. There are obviously many factors that influence every move, but this is likely an important component when there is a sharp correction down to the start of the channel.


>Since the second part of the pattern is a channel, the behavior during the channel phase is like that of any other channel. Almost all spike and channel bull patterns end with a breakout through the bottom of the channel and a test to around the bottom of the channel. The easiest reversal setup to spot is a three-push pattern in a channel with a wedge shape, where the third push overshoots the trend channel line and reverses with a strong reversal bar,especially if there is a second entry. However, most of the time the reversal is not so clear and it is better to wait for a breakout pullback setup. For example, if there is a breakout below a bull channel, wait for a pullback to a higher high or lower high, and if there is a good bear setup, go short. If the sell-off reaches the bottom of the channel and sets up a buy, then look to go long for the double bottom bull flag bounce.



>If there is a strong spike and any pullback, even a single bar, and then the trend resumes, the odds favor a spike and channel trend. For example, if there is a strong spike up that broke out of a trading range and then an inside bar, and then a bar that falls below the inside bar but reverses up into a bull reversal bar, traders will buy above that bar in anticipation of a bull channel. As soon as the market goes above that bull reversal bar, a channel is in effect. It can have a single push up lasting from one to several bars (a final flag reversal, which is discussed in book 3) and then reverse into a bear leg, or it can have two or more legs and then reverse. If the channel up is developing in an area where a reversal seems probable, like near the top of a trading range, it may reverse after a couple of legs up, before clear channel lines can be drawn. If it is forming in an area where a bull trend is probable, like in a reversal up from a strong bottom pattern, it will usually have at least three pushes, but it could have many more.


>Just how far can a channel go? In a strong trend, it usually goes much farther than what most traders believe is likely. However, if the spike is large, one measured move target is from the open or low of the first bar of the spike to the close or high of the last bar of the spike, and then you project that same number of points up. Another measured move target is a leg 1 =leg 2 move where the spike is leg 1 and the channel is leg 2. Look to see if a reversal is setting up once the channel is at the measured move target.


>You will usually see other measured move projections and trend line and trend channel line targets as well, but most of these targets will fail, especially if the trend is very strong.However, it is important to look for them because when a reversal finally does set up, it will usually be at one of these resistance areas, and that will give you more confidence to take the reversal trade. In general, it is far better to look at measured move targets as areas to take profits than as locations to take reversal trades. Traders should take a reversal trade only when the setup is strong, and reversal trading is discussed in book 3. Experienced traders will often scalp against the trend at measured move targets, sometimes scaling in if the market goes against them (scaling in is discussed in book 2), but very few traders can consistently do this profitably and most will lose money if they try.


>A strong spike is a sign that the market is quickly moving to a new price level where both the bulls and bears feel that there is value in placing trades. The market usually overshoots the value area and then pulls back into what will become a trading range. Because both the bulls and the bears are satisfied with the prices in this new area, the directional probability of an equidistant move is about 50 percent in the middle of the trading range. That means that there is about an equal chance that the market will move up X ticks before it moves down X ticks. This uncertainty is the hallmark of a trading range. It does not matter why the market is trending. All that matters is that it is moving quickly. You can view the move as a breakout and a move away from some prior price or as a move toward some magnet. That magnet can be a key price level like a prior spike, a measured move, or a trend line. Or you can think of the breakout as a move toward neutrality where the directional probability is once again about 50percent. This always occurs in a trading range, so once the directional probability has fallen to 50 percent, a trading range will become evident. A trend is simply a move from one trading range to another, and while in the new trading range, both the bulls and the bears are placing trades in an attempt to be positioned for what they believe will be the next breakout. This is discussed more in the section on the mathematics of trading in book 2.


>As an example, if the market is in a bull channel, the directional probability of an equidistant move starts to fall, and at some unknown point it hits 50 percent. This will ultimately be the middle of the trading range, but no one yet knows where that is and the market usually has to overshoot to the upside and downside as it searches for neutrality. As the market is going up in the channel, traders will assume that the directional probability of higher prices is still better than 50 percent until it is clearly less than 50 percent. That clarity occurs at some magnet, and at that point everyone sees that the market has gone too far. This will be the general area of the top of the trading range, and the directional probability at the top of a trading range favors the bears. The result is that the market will trade down in search of neutrality, but it will usually overshoot it again because neutrality is never clear but excess is.Once the market gets to some magnet (discussed in book 2), traders will see that it has gone down too far and it will reverse up. Eventually, the range will become tighter as traders home in on neutrality, which is a price level where both the bulls and the bears feel there is value in placing trades. They are in balance and the market is then in breakout mode. Before long,perceived value will change and the market will have to break out again to find the new value area.


>Once you recognize that a spike and channel trend is in effect, do not take countertrend trades in the hope that an ABC pullback will extend far enough for a scalper's profit. This is because invariably there will not have been any prior trend line break, and the tightness of the channel makes countertrend trading a losing strategy. The failures of these countertrend scalps are great with-trend setups. Just enter on a stop where the countertrend traders are exiting with their protective stops.


>Aggressive traders will enter channels using limit orders, trading with trend until two-sided trading becomes prominent, and which point they will start trading countertrend. For example, if there is a bear spike and then a channel, bears will enter with limit orders at or above the highs of the prior bars. As the channel approaches support levels, they will watch to see if the bars are overlapping more, if there are more and stronger bull trend bars, if there are more dojis, and if there are bigger pullbacks. The more of these signs of two-sided trading that are present, the more willing the bulls will be to buy with limit orders at and below the lows of prior bars and swing lows, and the less willing bears will be to short above or below bars. Bears will scale out of their profitable trades after the trend has gone on for a while and is in the area of measured move targets or other types of support. Bulls will begin to scale into longs in the same areas. The increased buying and reduced selling ultimately lead to a breakout above the bear trend line.


>Institutions and traders who have large enough accounts can scale into a coun-tertrendposition, expecting the market to test the start of the channel, but most traders should trade only with trend until there is a clear sign of a reversal. Also, it is risky to scale into a countertrend position in a channel in the second half of the day, because you will often run out of time. You will find yourself holding an ever-larger losing position and you will be forced to buy it back with a large loss by the close. When the bears are scaling in, some will look for a large bull trend bar that breaks above a prior swing high. They will see it as a possible exhaustive top of the trading range that should soon form. They will place limit orders to short the close of the bar and above its high, because they see the channel as the first leg of a trading range, and shorting bull spikes in the area of the top of a trading range is a standard trading range technique (discussed in book 2 on trading ranges). After the trading range has formed, traders will look back and see that the bull channel was the start of the range, and very experienced traders can begin to use trading range trading techniques as the channel is forming, if they believe that the market is in the area of the top of the soon-to-be trading range.


>The spike that forms before the channel is a thin area on the chart (there is very little overlap of adjacent bars, and is a type of breakout or measuring gap, as discussed in the second book)where there is agreement between the bulls and the bears that the market is mispriced, and therefore the market moves through it quickly. Both are contributing to the rapid move away from the prices in the spike as they search for the equilibrium that can be inferred to exist once the channel starts to form. Yes, the market is still trending because one side is still dominant, but there is finally some two-sided trading. The channel itself usually has lots of overlapping bars and pullbacks and is essentially a steeply sloped tight trading range. Since this type of price action represents two-sided trading, it is reasonable to expect the start of the pattern to be tested before too long, despite how strong the trend has been. For example, in a spike and channel bear trend, all of those early bulls who bought at the very start of the bear channel, thinking that the spike would become a failed breakout, are finally back to breakeven on the pullback to that area, and this will make the pullback function like a double top. These bulls will exit around breakeven on those early longs and may not want to buy unless the market falls back again. This is likely an important component of the reason why there is usually at least some downward movement after the top of the channel is tested. Any channel is usually the first leg of a trading range and is most often followed by a countertrend move that tests the start of the channel and reveals the trading range. At that point, the trading range usually expands in duration and has at least a partial move in the direction of the original channel. From there, the market behaves like a trading range and is in breakout mode (traders are looking for a breakout) and the breakout into a new trend can come in either direction.


>Sometimes the channel is so vertical that it accelerates and becomes parabolic. Although there is so little overlap between consecutive bars that it does not look like a typical channel,this parabolic move functions like the channel phase and is therefore a variant of a spike and channel trend. This parabolic move will often contain a large trend bar. For example, if there is a bear spike, which is one or more large bear trend bars, then a pause, and then another bear spike, then you have consecutive sell climaxes. Every large trend bar should be thought of as a spike, a breakout, a gap, and a climax. When there are consecutive climaxes (separated by a pause or a small pullback), they are usually followed by a two-legged correction that tests the pause that followed the first climax. The second climax should be thought of as the channel phase of the spike and channel pattern, even though it is another spike and not a low-momentum channel. However, since what usually follows is the same as with a conventional spike and channel pattern, consecutive climaxes form a variant of a spike and channel trend.Rarely, there will even be a third consecutive climax before a more complex correction ensues.


>Why does the market tend to have a larger correction after consecutive sell climaxes? When there is a sell climax, there is panic selling. Weak bulls feel that they have to get out of their longs at any price. Also, weak bears see the strong momentum and are afraid they are missing a great move so they are shorting at the market to make sure they get in. If the market pauses and then has another large bear bar, that second sell climax again represents urgent sellers who don't want to wait for a pullback that may never come. Once these weak longs are out and the weak bears are in, there is no one left to short at these low prices and this creates an imbalance to the buy side. There aren't enough bears left to take the opposite side of the trade, so the market has to go up to find enough traders willing to short to fill the buy orders.The opposite is true with consecutive buy climaxes. They represent urgency. Traders feel compelled to buy at the market as it is rising quickly because they are afraid that there will not be a pullback that will let them sell at a better price. Once these emotional weak bears and bulls (the late bulls are weak) have bought all that they want to buy at these high prices, there is no one left to buy and the market has to come down to attract more buyers. The result is a correction that usually has two legs and lasts at least 10 bars or so.


>Another type of a strong channel occurs in a spike and climax trend. Here, after the pause from the spike, the market creates another spike. All spikes are climaxes and when the market forms consecutive climaxes, it usually will form a larger correction, often to the beginning of the second spike. But this is exactly how a spike and channel behaves and it is therefore a variant, where there is a second spike instead of a channel. Sometimes the climax is a spike and the spike is more of a channel. For example, there might be a bull channel that then has a large one-bar bull spike. This can become a spike and climax reversal. Even though there was a channel and then a spike, it behaves like a traditional spike and channel pattern.


>Since any strong vertical move can function as a spike, a gap opening qualifies. If you look at the Standard & Poor's (S&P) cash index on a day when the Emini has a large gap up opening,you will see that the first bar of the cash index is not a gap.

>Instead, it is a large bull trend bar with its open around the close of yesterday and its close around the close of the first bar of the Emini. If there is then a pause or pullback and then a channel, this is a gap spike and channel trend.

>When the channel is very steep, the spike and channel often together form just a spike on a higher time frame chart, and that spike will usually be followed by a channel on that higher time frame. At other times there will be a spike that lasts several bars but there is no channel.Usually the final bars of the spike have some overlap and there actually is a channel on a smaller time frame chart.


>There will sometimes be a large bull trend bar, which is a spike up, and then a large bear trend bar, which is a spike down. When this happens in a bull trend that has gone on for a while, the market usually enters a trading range, with the bulls trying to generate a bull channel and the bears trying for a bear channel. Eventually one side wins and either the trend resumes or the market forms a spike and channel bear trend. The opposite happens in bear trends, where there is then a large bear trend bar. If there is a bull spike bar soon afterward, the market usually goes sideways as the two sides fight over the direction of the channel. If the bears win,the bear trend will resume, and if the bulls win, there will be a reversal. Sometimes one side appears to win in the form of a second spike, but it fails within a bar or two and leads to a channel in the opposite direction.


>A spike and channel pattern is composed of two parts, and they are best traded differently. A spike is a breakout and is traded like all breakouts, which are discussed in book 2. In general, if the breakout appears to be very strong and in the context where it is likely to be successful,you can enter at the market or on small pullbacks as the spike is forming. Since a spike is also a climax, there will be a pull-back at some point and this provides other opportunities to enter with the trend. Finally, the channel is no different from any other channel. If it is a tight bull channel, you can enter in the direction of the trend on pullbacks, such as those to the trend line or the moving average, or on a limit order below the low of the prior bar, or every 10 cents lower in Intel (INTC) when it is trading at $20. If the channel has broader swings, it has stronger two-sided trading and you can take trades in both directions. Since a channel is a flag in the opposite direction, once it starts to reverse you can take the reversal trade. It usually corrects to around the beginning of the channel where you can enter on a test of the start of the channel, which will be a double bottom bull flag in a spike and channel bull pullback, and a double top bear flag in a spike and channel bear pullback.


>If the channel has lots of overlap between adjacent bars and many trend bars in the opposite direction and several pullbacks that last several bars, it is a weak channel. The weaker the channel, the more aggressive the institutional counter trend traders will be. For example, if there is a weak bear channel after a bear spike, strong bulls will scale in as the market moves lower. There will be firms buying with every conceivable reason, like buying below the low of every bar or every prior swing low, or buying every $1.00 lower in Google (GOOG) when it is trading at $500, or on every test of the trend channel line, or on every reversal bar on a small time frame chart, or on every $1.00 bounce up off the low in GOOG, in case the reversal up has begun. If, instead of breaking out of the top of the channel, the market breaks strongly out of the bottom and creates a strong bear spike that lasts several bars, these bulls will have to cover by exiting their longs. As they sell out of their longs, they add to the strength of the bear breakout, and they might even reverse to short for a momentum trade down. However, in most cases the downside breakout will not go very far, and once the last desperate bulls have sold out of their positions, there is no one left who is willing to short at these low prices. The market will usually rally for at least two legs and at least 10 bars as it searches for a higher price where bears might be willing to short once again.

>When the market is trending strongly and then develops a spike in the opposite direction, the spike will usually lead to just a pullback (a flag) and then the trend will resume. However, it is a statement that the traders who believe that the market might reverse are now willing to begin taking positions. If the market begins to form one or two more spikes over the next 10 to 20 bars, the countertrend force of those spikes is cumulative and the market is transitioning to more two-sided trading. This can develop into a trading range, a deeper correction, or even a trend reversal. For example, if there is a very strong bull trend of any type, not simply a spike and channel bull, and the market has been above the moving average for 20 or more bars and it is at its high, then the bull trend is very strong. If there is suddenly a moderately sized bear trend bar that opens near its high and closes near its low, this is a bear spike. The bar can be a bear reversal bar, an entry bar below a bear reversal bar, or even an inside bar, and it does not matter. This first spike down will almost always just lead to a bull flag. After the bull trend resumes, watch for another bear spike. Eventually one will be followed by a pullback to the moving average. This first pullback to the moving average will usually be followed by a test of the high of the bull trend. The test can be in the form of a higher high, a double top, or a lower high. However, the pullback to the moving average is usually enough to break at least some bull trend line and then the rally that follows might be the final rally before a significant pullback or even a reversal takes place.

>If there is a third and larger bear spike at the new high, the odds of at least a two-legged correction increase, and the move down after the spike down will usually be in some type of channel. Is the market ignoring those prior two bear spikes? The market never ignores anything. Although this latest bear spike might be the one everyone considers to be the seminal event, there is a cumulative effect from the other bear spikes as well. In fact, if the second bear spike was particularly strong and then the market rallied to a new high, and the next bear spike was modest but it led to a correction, you have to consider a different interpretation of what just took place. It is possible that the second bear spike was actually the more important one, and was the actual start of the down move, and that the rally to the new high after the spike was simply a pullback from that spike. It is important to understand that any breakout pullback can test the old extreme with either a lower high, a double top, or a higher high, and that test can often be the start of the bear channel. Although it may appear that the small spike down began the bear trend and that the channel that followed it was the first bear channel, sometimes the earlier spike is more influential. Its channel can begin at the high of the bull trend, and it can begin with that smaller spike down from the high. The channel that follows that small bear spike is then inside the larger channel that began at the bull high, just before that small bear spike formed.


>When the market is in a trading range, it often has both a bull spike and a bear spike. The bulls and bears then fight to create a channel. Eventually one side will dominate and will be able to form a trend channel. It often begins with a breakout, which is then a second spike. Both spikes contribute to the formation of the channel.


>A bull channel is a bear flag and a bear channel is a bull flag, and like all flags they are continuation patterns that usually break out in the direction of the trend. However,sometimes they break out in the opposite direction, leading to a trend reversal. The breakout is a spike, so instead of a spike and channel trend, the market forms a channel and spike trend that is unrelated to a spike and channel pattern. But usually the spike is followed by a channel. For example, if there is a bear trend and it has a pullback, the pullback is a rising channel and therefore a bear flag. Sometimes the channel will break out to the upside. A breakout is a bull trend bar and a spike, and if the breakout is successful, the follow-through will be a channel. The bull trend began with the spike, and that spike and the channel that follows form a spike and channel bull trend. The original channel was the final flag of the bear trend and it broke to the upside, but it is not related to the spike and channel bull trend that followed. The spike changed the market and it is the start of the new perspective for traders,who will then ignore the bear flag that preceded it.

>A similar situation happens when a wedge reversal fails. For example, a wedge top is a rising bull channel, and therefore a bear flag, and it usually breaks to the downside. If instead it breaks to the upside, the breakout is a spike and it may be followed by a channel and a measured move up. The breakout always resets the mind-set and should be thought of as the start of a new trend. In this case, the trend is still a bull trend, like the trend before the wedge,but now it is an even stronger bull trend. Usually, upside breakouts do not go more than five to 10 bars before reversing into either a protracted, two-legged pullback or a trend in the opposite direction. They represent exceptionally climactic and therefore overdone buying.This is at the tails of the bell curve of behavior, and institutions will have all sorts of indicators telling them that the bull trend is overdone and should correct. Each institution will rely on its own measure of excess, but enough institutions usually will see the rally as excessive and their bets that the market will fall will soon overwhelm the bulls, and the reversal will ensue.


>Spike and channel behavior is one of the most common and therefore most important things that you will see on every chart. There are countless variations and many interpretations of every pattern. Sometimes the spike will be one bar, but then, after a pause, there will be an even better-looking spike. The channel can be so vertical that it functions as part of the spike,and the spike and channel might be simply a spike on a higher time frame. That channel can be very small or very large relative to the spike. When there is a strong trend, there will usually be several spikes within the channel, and the channel can subdivide into smaller spike and channel patterns. Be open to all possibilities because they all have the potential to offer profitable trading opportunities.

### 急涨通道型趋势日的主要特征

**急涨通道型趋势日（Spike and Channel Trend Days）** 是最常见的趋势类型，几乎每天都会以某种形式出现，存在于每一种趋势中。它有无数种变体，并且通常会有许多更小的急涨通道模式嵌套在更大的模式之中。由于它经常是控制大量价格行为的主导力量，交易者理解它至关重要。这是一种由两个组成部分构成的模式：

---

#### 急涨阶段 (Spike Phase)

- **突发性与方向性：** 市场由一根或多根趋势K线组成一个**急涨**，这表明市场正在突破并进入一个明确的“总是顺势”状态。
    
- **紧迫感与加仓：** 在急涨期间，市场会有一种紧迫感，交易者会趁势加仓。急涨实际上是一种**突破性跳空**（在第二本书中详细讨论）。
    
- **形成时间：** 急涨通常在交易日的第一小时内形成，并且常常在最初的几根K线内出现。
    
- **突破强度与通道后续：** 突破越强劲，随后形成通道的可能性就越大，并且通道延伸得越远（参见第19章的趋势强度和第二本书第2章的突破强度部分）。
    
- **量度移动基础：** 当突破强劲时，它通常是**量度移动**的基础，通道可能在此结束，您最终可以在此部分或全部获利了结。
    
- **急涨后的回调：** 紧随急涨之后会出现一个回调，短则一根K线，长则几十根K线。
    

---

#### 通道阶段 (Channel Phase)

- **趋势恢复：** 趋势以通道的形式恢复。在通道期间，由于双向交易的存在，市场会弥漫着担忧和不确定感。
    
- **交易策略：** 当市场处于通道中时，最好将其视为一个**趋势性交易区间**进行交易。例如，在牛市通道中，最好在前期K线低点下方买入并**波段持有**部分仓位；如果您进行任何做空，则在摆动高点或前期K线高点上方卖出，并且主要进行**剥头皮交易**。
    
- **顺势突破的罕见性：** 通道很少会向顺势方向突破，但一旦突破，通常会在五根K线内失败，然后市场反转。
    
- **通道终结：** 通道会在某个**量度移动目标**处结束，并且通常在第三次推动后。
    
- **逆势突破与等待回调：** 如果通道最终向逆势方向突破（通常如此），不要在突破时入场，而是等待回调（例如，如果是牛市急涨通道，当市场跌破通道时，寻找更低高点做空）。
    
- **回调目标：** 市场通常会修正到通道的起点，这是对跳空的测试（急涨和所有急涨一样，都是一种跳空）。
    
- **形成交易区间：** 市场随后通常会向趋势方向反弹至少25%，试图形成一个**交易区间**。在牛市急涨通道中，回调通常会与通道底部形成一个**双重底牛旗**，这个双重底是急涨后回调的底部。
    
- **弱势情况：** 如果通道较弱，它更可能是一个**趋势性交易区间日**（在下一章中讨论）。

### 急涨通道模式的构成与演变

急涨通道模式由两个部分组成，最好以不同的方式进行交易。

1. **急涨（Spike）**：由一根或多根K线组成，市场快速移动。这是一种**突破性跳空**，市场迅速从一个价格水平转移到另一个价格水平。这期间充满紧迫感，市场参与者普遍认为市场会进一步发展。急涨阶段是市场快速脱离旧的价值区域，寻找新的均衡点的过程。
    
2. **回调（Pullback）**：紧随急涨之后，可能短至一根K线，也可能持续数十根K线，甚至可能回撤到急涨的起始点之外（例如，牛市急涨后，回调有时会跌破急涨底部，然后通道开始）。
    
3. **通道（Channel）**：在回调之后，趋势转变为通道，此时紧迫感降低，更多的是担忧和不确定感，这就是所谓的“忧虑之墙”。市场呈现双向交易，趋势看起来随时可能结束，但它却不断延伸。交易者会迅速获利了结，但随着趋势的持续，他们会不断重新入场或加仓，因为他们不确定趋势何时结束，并希望确保参与其中。
    

极少数情况下，会出现第二个急涨阶段，然后是另一个通道，但通常第二个急涨会成为**失败突破**，随后是修正。例如，如果先是牛市急涨，然后是动量较低的牛市通道，市场可能会以另一个牛市急涨突破通道顶部。这种情况下，很少会接着出现另一个牛市通道，更多时候急涨会成为失败突破，然后市场向下修正。

---

### 急涨的本质与市场行为

当市场出现一系列K线覆盖大量点位，且几乎没有回调时，这种强劲趋势就是**急涨**。急涨可以是一根趋势K线，一系列重叠很少的趋势K线，甚至是一个非常紧密的通道。事实上，在特定时间框架上的急涨，在更小的时间框架上就是一个陡峭、紧密的通道。同样，陡峭、紧密的通道在更高时间框架上就是急涨。

急涨在第一次暂停K线或回调之前结束，因为正是这种暂停标志着急涨的结束。如果在一两根K线内恢复，它会变成第二次急涨，或者在更大的时间框架上成为一个急涨。急涨可以小到一根中等大小的趋势K线，也可以持续10根或更多K线。急涨、高潮和突破应该被视为相同的事物，在第二本书关于突破的章节中有更多讨论。

在一次上涨急涨中，所有人都认为这不是空头的价值区域，因此市场需要进一步上涨才能找到多空双方都愿意交易的价格。市场会继续快速上涨，直到多头愿意获利了结，并且不太愿意买入新头寸，而空头开始做空。这会导致暂停或回调，这是双向交易首次出现的重要迹象。下跌急涨的情况则相反。

---

### 趋势的普遍性与识别

几乎所有的趋势都以急涨开始，即使它只是一根趋势K线，直到很多K线之后才被识别为趋势的开始。因此，几乎所有的趋势都是急涨通道趋势的变体。然而，当趋势具有本章讨论的其他趋势类型的更多特征时，您应该将其作为那种类型进行交易，以最大化成功机会。

根据定义，急涨在第一次暂停K线或回调之前立即结束，因为正是暂停标志着急涨的结束。市场随后可以做三件显而易见的事情：趋势恢复、市场进入**交易区间**或趋势反转。第一种可能性最常见：市场回调几根K线，或可能十多根K线，然后趋势恢复。这次回调是对跳空的测试（记住，急涨是一个跳空），也是通道的开始。当趋势恢复时，它通常不如之前强劲，表现为更多的重叠K线、更平坦的斜率、一些回调以及一些反方向的趋势K线。这就是通道，然后模式就变成了急涨通道趋势。

---

### 回调的延伸与趋势的终结

第二种可能性是，如果回调持续超过10根K线，它就会演变为一个**交易区间**，该区间可以向任一方向突破。一般来说，**交易区间**突破的方向总是倾向于与原始趋势相同。如果**交易区间**持续很长时间，它在更高时间框架图表上只是一个旗形（例如，5分钟图上持续三天的**交易区间**紧随牛市急涨之后，通常在60分钟图上只是一个牛旗，并且上涨突破的概率更高）。这是一种**趋势恢复**情况，本章后面会讨论。尽管趋势通常在收盘前恢复，并且当天成为趋势恢复日，但**交易区间**的突破有时可能会在几根K线内失败或反转（最终旗形反转在第三本书反转章节中有讨论）。极少数情况下，**交易区间**会持续数小时甚至数天，并且波动非常小（这是一种紧密**交易区间**，在第二本书**交易区间**章节中讨论）。与任何**交易区间**一样，突破可以向任一方向进行，但略微更有可能向趋势方向进行。

第三种可能性是市场反转。只要急涨后的回调不足以将“总是顺势”交易翻转到相反方向，市场很可能会继续趋势，并且这种延续几乎总是以通道的形式出现。较少情况下，市场会反转并形成相反方向的急涨。当这种情况发生时，市场通常会进入**交易区间**，因为多空双方会争夺**跟进动量**。多头会继续买入，试图在牛市急涨后形成牛市通道；空头会继续卖出，试图在熊市急涨后形成熊市通道。尽管**交易区间**可能会持续一天剩余的时间，但通常一方会获胜，市场会突破。届时，要么形成通道，当天成为急涨通道趋势日，要么突破很快被另一个**交易区间**跟随，市场形成**趋势性交易区间日**，这将在下一章中讨论。

除了以相反方向的急涨反转外，市场也可以在急涨后形成**交易区间**而反转。例如，如果先是牛市急涨，然后是**交易区间**，大约三分之一的情况下，市场会向下突破**交易区间**底部而不是顶部。突破可能由一个急剧、大型的看跌急涨引起，但更常见的是由一个不显眼的看跌趋势K线引起，随后是一个看跌通道。

---

### 通道交易：顺势为主，警惕逆势

如果形成通道，最好只在趋势方向进行交易。有时通道中会有大的摆动，这可以在通道进展中提供逆势剥头皮机会。请注意，通道可能比您想象的持续时间长得多，并且它们总是看起来像要反转。沿途会有许多回调，将交易者引入错误的方向。通常会有许多带影线的K线，许多反方向的趋势K线，以及大量重叠的K线，但它仍然是一个趋势，过早地逆势交易代价高昂。

有些日子会有早期的强劲动量走势（急涨），然后趋势以不那么陡峭的通道持续一整天。然而，通道有时会加速并遵循抛物线曲线而不是线性路径。在其他时候，它会失去动量并形成更平坦的曲线。无论如何，通道的起点通常会在当天晚些时候或接下来的一两天内得到测试，测试之后可能是**交易区间**或任何方向的趋势。重要的是要认识到，如果通道相当紧凑，它只能在顺势方向进行交易，因为回调不会延伸到足以使逆势交易盈利的程度。通道具有宽幅摆动的频率要低得多，这种情况下可以在两个方向进行交易。

当通道逆势突破时，您应该准备好寻找逆势入场机会，因为逆势走势很有可能延伸到测试通道起点，并尝试形成**交易区间**。请记住，无论通道多么陡峭，它都是反方向的旗形。牛市通道是熊旗，熊市通道是牛旗。此外，即使通道是一个倾斜的**交易区间**，它也是更大**交易区间**的第一“腿”，并且反转通常会回到通道起点附近。例如，如果先是急涨，然后是回调，再是牛市通道，那么牛市通道通常是一个尚未展开的**交易区间**的第一“腿”。市场通常会修正下跌到通道底部，在那里它会尝试与通道底部形成一个**双重底牛旗**。这通常会导致反弹，这是正在形成的**交易区间**的第三“腿”。反弹之后，交易者应该开始寻找其他模式，因为此时急涨通道模式的可预测性已经结束。急涨是一种突破，这意味着突破点和第一次回调（通道的起点）之间会有一个跳空。对通道底部的测试是对跳空的测试，也是一个突破测试。

---

### 拥挤交易与快速修正

股票交易者通常将牛市通道的结束描述为**拥挤交易**，因为他们认为所有对该股票感兴趣的人都已做多，没有剩余的买盘。他们随后预期将快速下跌至通道起点，因为所有通道买家都会出场。随着股票快速下跌，他们认为看跌“腿”是由所有迟入场的、有未实现亏损的多头迅速出逃以最小化损失造成的。人群涌向出口的这种行为导致了下跌的迅速和深度。显然，有许多因素影响每一次走势，但这很可能是当市场急剧修正下跌到通道起点时的一个重要组成部分。

由于模式的第二部分是通道，通道阶段的行为就像任何其他通道一样。几乎所有的急涨通道看涨模式都以向下突破通道底部并测试通道底部附近结束。最容易发现的反转“交易机会”是通道中的**三推模式**，呈楔形，第三次推动超调趋势通道线并伴随强劲的反转K线反转，特别是如果存在第二次入场机会。然而，大多数时候反转并不那么清晰，最好等待**突破回调交易机会**。例如，如果看涨通道下方出现突破，等待回调形成更高高点或更低高点，如果出现好的看跌“交易机会”，就做空。如果跌势达到通道底部并形成买入“交易机会”，则寻找做多以实现**双重底牛旗**的反弹。

---

### 强势急涨与通道的延伸

如果存在强劲的急涨和任何回调（即使是单根K线），然后趋势恢复，那么急涨通道趋势的可能性很高。例如，如果有一个强劲的急涨突破**交易区间**，然后是一个内包K线，再然后是一根跌破内包K线但反转上涨形成看涨反转K线的K线，交易者就会在该K线上方买入，预期形成牛市通道。一旦市场突破该看涨反转K线，通道就已生效。它可能只有一次上涨推动，持续一到几根K线（**最终旗形反转**，第三本书有讨论），然后反转进入看跌“腿”，或者它可以有两“腿”或更多“腿”然后反转。如果上涨通道形成于可能反转的区域，例如**交易区间**顶部附近，它可能会在几次上涨后反转，在清晰的通道线形成之前。如果它形成于可能出现牛市趋势的区域，例如从强劲底部模式反转上涨，它通常至少会有三次推动，但可能更多。

通道能走多远？在强劲趋势中，它通常比大多数交易者认为的可能走得更远。然而，如果急涨幅度很大，一个**量度移动目标**是从急涨的第一根K线开盘价或低点到急涨最后一根K线收盘价或高点，然后将相同的点数向上投射。另一个**量度移动目标**是第一“腿”等于第二“腿”的移动，其中急涨是第一“腿”，通道是第二“腿”。一旦通道达到**量度移动目标**，就观察是否正在形成反转。

---

### 量度目标与反转交易

您通常还会看到其他**量度移动预测**以及趋势线和趋势通道线目标，但这些目标大多会失败，特别是当趋势非常强劲时。然而，寻找它们很重要，因为当反转最终形成时，它通常会在这些阻力区域之一，这将使您对进行反转交易更有信心。

总的来说，将**量度移动目标**视为获利了结区域远比将其视为进行反转交易的位置更好。交易者只应在**交易机会**强劲时才进行反转交易，反转交易在第三本书中有讨论。经验丰富的交易者通常会在**量度移动目标**处逆势剥头皮，有时如果市场反向移动会**分批加仓**（**分批加仓**在第二本书中有讨论），但很少有交易者能持续盈利地这样做，大多数人尝试后会亏损。

---

### 急涨：市场重新定价的标志

强劲的急涨表明市场正在快速移动到新的价格水平，多头和空头都觉得在那里进行交易有价值。市场通常会**超调**价值区域，然后回调进入将成为**交易区间**的区域。因为多头和空头都对这个新区域的价格感到满意，**等距移动**的方向概率在**交易区间**的中间约为50%。这意味着市场向上移动X个跳动点或向下移动X个跳动点的可能性大致相等。这种不确定性是**交易区间**的标志。市场为什么会趋势并不重要。重要的是它在快速移动。您可以将这种移动视为突破和远离某个先前价格的移动，或者视为向某个磁石（magnet）移动。这个磁石可以是关键价格水平，如先前的急涨、**量度移动**或趋势线。或者您可以认为突破是向中性区域移动，在那里方向概率再次约为50%。这总是发生在**交易区间**中，所以一旦方向概率降至50%，**交易区间**就会变得明显。趋势仅仅是从一个**交易区间**到另一个**交易区间**的移动，而在新的**交易区间**中，多头和空头都在进行交易，试图为他们认为的下一次突破做好准备。这在第二本书关于交易数学的部分有更多讨论。

举例来说，如果市场处于牛市通道中，**等距移动**的方向概率开始下降，在某个未知点达到50%。这最终将是**交易区间**的中间，但目前没有人知道它在哪里，市场通常必须向上和向下**超调**，以寻找中性。当市场在通道中上涨时，交易者会假定价格上涨的方向概率仍然大于50%，直到它明确小于50%。这种明确性出现在某个磁石处，此时所有人都认为市场已经走得太远了。这将是**交易区间**顶部的普遍区域，而**交易区间**顶部的方向概率有利于空头。结果是市场将下跌寻找中性，但它通常会再次**超调**，因为中性永远不明确，而过度则明确。一旦市场到达某个磁石（第二本书有讨论），交易者会认为它跌得太远了，并会反转上涨。最终，**交易区间**会变得更紧，因为交易者会集中在中性点，这是一个多头和空头都觉得有价值进行交易的价格水平。他们处于平衡状态，市场随后处于突破模式（交易者正在寻找突破），而新的趋势突破可以向任一方向出现。

---

### 逆势交易的风险与顺势交易的优先

一旦您识别出急涨通道趋势正在生效，就不要进行逆势交易，希望**ABC回调**能延伸到足以让剥头皮交易者获利。这是因为通常不会有任何先前的趋势线突破，而且通道的紧密性使得逆势交易成为亏损策略。这些逆势剥头皮交易的失败，正是绝佳的**顺势交易机会**。只需在逆势交易者因止损而离场的地方入场。

激进的交易者会使用限价订单入场通道，顺势交易直到双向交易变得显著，此时他们将开始逆势交易。例如，如果先是熊市急涨，然后是通道，空头将使用限价订单在前期K线高点或上方入场。当通道接近支撑水平时，他们会观察K线是否更多重叠，是否有更多更强的看涨趋势K线，是否有更多十字星K线，以及是否有更大的回调。这些双向交易的迹象越多，多头就越愿意使用限价订单在前期K线低点或下方以及摆动低点买入，而空头则越不愿意在K线上下做空。空头会在趋势持续一段时间并处于**量度移动目标**或其他支撑区域时，**分批了结盈利交易**。多头将开始在同一区域**分批做多**。买盘增加和卖盘减少最终导致突破看跌趋势线。

机构和账户足够大的交易者可以**分批逆势建仓**，预期市场会测试通道的起点，但大多数交易者应该只进行顺势交易，直到出现明确的反转迹象。此外，在交易日后半段，在通道中逆势加仓是有风险的，因为您常常会时间不够。您会发现自己持有越来越大的亏损头寸，并且在收盘时将被迫以巨大亏损平仓。当空头**分批加仓**时，有些人会寻找突破前期摆动高点的大型看涨趋势K线。他们会将其视为即将形成的**交易区间**的可能竭尽顶部。他们会在K线收盘时和高点上方设置限价空单，因为他们将通道视为**交易区间**的第一“腿”，而在**交易区间**顶部区域做空牛市急涨是一种标准**交易区间**技术（第二本书**交易区间**章节有讨论）。在**交易区间**形成后，交易者会回顾并看到牛市通道是**交易区间**的开始，非常有经验的交易者如果在通道形成时相信市场处于即将形成的**交易区间**顶部区域，就可以开始使用**交易区间**交易技术。

---

### 急涨与通道的内在机制

在通道形成之前的急涨是图表上的一个薄弱区域（相邻K线重叠很少，是一种突破或量度跳空，如第二本书中所述），在此区域，多空双方都认为市场定价错误，因此市场快速通过它。双方都促成了快速脱离急涨中的价格，因为他们正在寻找一旦通道开始形成就可以推断存在的均衡点。是的，市场仍在趋势中，因为一方仍然占据主导地位，但最终出现了一些双向交易。通道本身通常有很多重叠的K线和回调，本质上是一个倾斜陡峭的紧密**交易区间**。由于这种价格行为代表双向交易，因此有理由预期模式的起点在不久之后会得到测试，无论趋势有多强劲。例如，在急涨通道看跌趋势中，所有那些早期在看跌通道开始时买入的多头（认为急涨会成为失败突破），在回调到那个区域时最终回到盈亏平衡点，这将使回调像**双重顶**一样发挥作用。这些多头将在那些早期多头头寸上接近盈亏平衡时出场，并且可能不愿意买入，除非市场再次下跌。这很可能是通道顶部被测试后通常至少会出现一些下行运动的重要原因之一。任何通道通常都是**交易区间**的第一“腿”，并且最常伴随着逆势走势，测试通道起点并揭示**交易区间**。此时，**交易区间**通常会在持续时间上扩大，并且至少会有部分走势与原始通道方向一致。从那里开始，市场表现得像一个**交易区间**，并处于突破模式（交易者正在寻找突破），新的趋势突破可以向任一方向出现。

---

### 极速通道：抛物线走势与连续高潮

有时通道会如此垂直以至于加速并变得**抛物线形**。尽管连续K线之间重叠很少，看起来不像典型的通道，但这种抛物线走势功能类似于通道阶段，因此是急涨通道趋势的一种变体。这种抛物线走势通常会包含一个大型趋势K线。例如，如果先是熊市急涨（一根或多根大型看跌趋势K线），然后是暂停，再然后是另一个熊市急涨，那么您就有了连续的**卖出高潮**。每一根大型趋势K线都应该被视为急涨、突破、跳空和高潮。当出现连续高潮（由暂停或小幅回调分隔）时，它们通常会伴随一个两“腿”修正，测试第一个高潮后的暂停。第二个高潮应该被视为急涨通道模式的通道阶段，即使它又是另一个急涨而不是低动量通道。然而，由于通常随之而来的与传统急涨通道模式相同，连续高潮形成急涨通道趋势的一种变体。极少数情况下，在更复杂的修正发生之前，甚至会出现第三次连续高潮。

---

### 连续高潮后的市场修正原因

为什么市场在连续**卖出高潮**后倾向于出现更大修正？当出现**卖出高潮**时，会出现恐慌性抛售。弱势多头觉得他们必须不惜一切代价平掉多头仓位。此外，弱势空头看到强劲的**动量**，害怕错过一次大行情，所以他们市价做空，以确保入场。如果市场暂停，然后又出现一根大型看跌K线，那么第二次**卖出高潮**再次代表着不愿等待可能永远不会出现回调的紧急卖家。一旦这些弱势多头离场，弱势空头入场，就没有人愿意在这些低价位做空了，这就会造成买方的失衡。没有足够的空头来承担交易的另一方，所以市场必须上涨才能找到足够多愿意做空的交易者来满足买单。连续**买入高潮**的情况则相反。它们代表着紧迫性。交易者觉得被迫在市场快速上涨时市价买入，因为他们担心不会出现回调让他们以更好的价格卖出。一旦这些情绪化的弱势空头和多头（迟入场的多头是弱势的）在这些高价位买入了所有他们想买的，就没有人愿意买入了，市场必须下跌才能吸引更多买家。结果是修正，通常有两“腿”，持续至少10根K线左右。

---

### 急涨与高潮趋势的变体

另一种强劲通道类型出现在**急涨和高潮趋势**中。在这里，在急涨暂停后，市场会形成另一个急涨。所有的急涨都是高潮，当市场形成连续高潮时，通常会形成更大的修正，通常会回到第二个急涨的起点。但这正是急涨通道模式的行为方式，因此它是一种变体，其中有第二个急涨而不是通道。有时高潮是急涨，而急涨更像是通道。例如，可能有一个牛市通道，然后出现一根大型单K线牛市急涨。这可能成为**急涨和高潮反转**。即使先是通道然后是急涨，它的行为也像传统的急涨通道模式。

由于任何强劲的垂直移动都可以作为急涨，**跳空开盘**也符合条件。如果您观察标准普尔（S&P）现金指数，在Emini指数大幅跳空高开的日子里，您会发现现金指数的第一根K线不是跳空。相反，它是一根大型看涨趋势K线，其开盘价接近昨日收盘价，收盘价接近Emini第一根K线的收盘价。如果随后有暂停或回调，然后是通道，这就是一个**跳空急涨通道趋势**。

当通道非常陡峭时，急涨和通道通常一起在更高时间框架图表上形成一个急涨，而那个急涨通常会在更高时间框架上被一个通道跟随。在其他时候，会出现一个持续几根K线的急涨，但没有通道。通常急涨的最后几根K线有一些重叠，实际上在更小的时间框架图表上存在一个通道。

---

### 市场多空对抗与通道突破

有时会出现一根大型看涨趋势K线，即一次上涨急涨，然后是一根大型看跌趋势K线，即一次下跌急涨。当这种情况发生在已经持续一段时间的牛市趋势中时，市场通常会进入**交易区间**，多头试图形成牛市通道，空头试图形成熊市通道。最终一方获胜，要么趋势恢复，要么市场形成急涨通道熊市趋势。熊市趋势中则发生相反的情况，随后会出现一根大型看跌趋势K线。如果很快出现看涨急涨K线，市场通常会横盘整理，因为双方争夺通道的方向。如果空头获胜，熊市趋势将恢复；如果多头获胜，将会出现反转。有时一方似乎以第二次急涨的形式获胜，但它在一两根K线内失败，并导致相反方向的通道。

急涨通道模式由两部分组成，最好以不同的方式进行交易。急涨是一种突破，像所有突破一样进行交易，第二本书中有讨论。一般来说，如果突破看起来非常强劲，并且在可能成功的背景下，您可以在急涨形成时市价入场或在小幅回调时入场。由于急涨也是一种高潮，在某个时候会有回调，这提供了其他顺势入场的机会。

最后，通道与任何其他通道没有什么不同。如果它是一个紧凑的牛市通道，您可以在回调时顺着趋势方向入场，例如回调到趋势线或移动平均线，或者在英特尔（INTC）交易价格为20美元时，以每10美分下跌的限价订单在前期K线低点下方入场。如果通道有更宽的摆动，它有更强的双向交易，您可以双向交易。由于通道是反方向的旗形，一旦它开始反转，您就可以进行反转交易。它通常会修正到通道起点附近，您可以在测试通道起点时入场，这在急涨通道牛市回调中将是**双重底牛旗**，在急涨通道熊市回调中将是**双重顶熊旗**。

---

### 弱势通道与机构逆势交易

当通道中相邻K线**重叠**很多，有许多**反方向趋势K线**，并且有几个持续数根K线的回调时，这是一个**弱势通道**。通道越弱，机构逆势交易者就越激进。

例如，如果熊市**急涨**后出现一个弱势熊市通道，强势多头会在市场走低时**分批加仓**。会有公司以各种可以想象到的理由买入，比如在每根K线低点下方或每个前期摆动低点下方买入，或者在谷歌（GOOG）交易价格为500美元时每下跌1.00美元买入，或者在每次测试趋势通道线时买入，或者在小时间框架图表上的每一次反转K线处买入，或者在GOOG从低点反弹每1.00美元时买入，以防上涨反转已经开始。

如果市场不是突破通道顶部，而是强劲突破底部并形成持续数根K线的强劲看跌**急涨**，这些多头将不得不通过平仓多头来**补仓**。当他们卖出多头仓位时，他们增加了看跌突破的强度，他们甚至可能反转做空以进行**动量交易**。然而，在大多数情况下，下行突破不会走得很远，一旦最后绝望的多头平仓，就没有人愿意在这些低价位做空了。市场通常会**至少反弹两“腿”**，并持续至少10根K线，以寻找一个更高的价格，空头可能愿意再次做空。

---

### 反向急涨与趋势的反转力量

当市场强劲趋势运行，随后出现一个反向的**急涨**时，这个**急涨**通常只会导致一次回调（一个旗形），然后趋势会恢复。然而，这表明那些认为市场可能反转的交易者现在愿意开始建仓。如果在接下来的10到20根K线内，市场开始形成一到两个更多的**急涨**，这些**急涨**的反趋势力量是累积的，市场正在向更多的**双向交易**过渡。这可能发展为**交易区间**、更深度的修正，甚至**趋势反转**。

例如，如果存在任何类型的非常强劲的牛市趋势（不仅仅是**急涨通道型牛市**），并且市场已经在移动平均线上方运行了20根或更多K线并处于其高点，那么牛市趋势非常强劲。如果突然出现一根中等大小的看跌趋势K线，其开盘价接近其高点，收盘价接近其低点，这是一个看跌**急涨**。这根K线可以是看跌反转K线、看跌反转K线下方的入场K线，甚至是内包K线，这并不重要。这种第一次下跌**急涨**几乎总是只会导致一个牛旗。牛市趋势恢复后，请观察另一个看跌**急涨**。最终其中一个**急涨**之后会是回调到移动平均线。第一次回调到移动平均线通常会伴随着对牛市趋势高点的测试。这个测试可以是更高的高点、**双重顶**或更低的高点。然而，回调到移动平均线通常足以突破至少一些牛市趋势线，随后的反弹可能是重大回调甚至反转之前的最后一次反弹。

---

### 连续急涨的累积效应与趋势终结

如果在新高处出现第三次更大规模的看跌**急涨**，那么**至少两“腿”修正的概率会增加**，并且**急涨**后的下跌走势通常会以某种类型的通道形式出现。市场是否会忽视之前那两次看跌**急涨**？市场从不忽视任何东西。尽管这最新的看跌**急涨**可能被所有人认为是具有开创性意义的事件，但其他看跌**急涨**也具有累积效应。

事实上，如果第二次看跌**急涨**特别强劲，随后市场反弹至新高，而下一次看跌**急涨**虽然温和但导致了修正，您就必须对刚刚发生的事情进行不同的解读。可能第二次看跌**急涨**实际上更重要，是下跌走势的实际起点，而**急涨**后反弹至新高只是该**急涨**的一次回调。重要的是要理解，任何**突破回调**都可以通过更低的高点、**双重顶**或更高的高点来测试旧的极端，并且这种测试常常是看跌通道的开始。尽管看起来小的下跌**急涨**开启了熊市趋势，而随后的通道是第一个看跌通道，但有时更早的**急涨**更有影响力。它的通道可以从牛市趋势的高点开始，也可以从那个来自高点的小型下跌**急涨**开始。随后的那个小型看跌**急涨**所形成的通道，然后会包含在那个在小型看跌**急涨**形成之前、从牛市高点开始的更大通道内部。

---

### 交易区间中的急涨与通道的形成

当市场处于**交易区间**时，它通常既有牛市**急涨**也有熊市**急涨**。多头和空头随后争相形成通道。最终一方将占据主导地位，并能够形成趋势通道。它通常以突破开始，这随后是第二次**急涨**。两次**急涨**都促成了通道的形成。

牛市通道是熊旗，熊市通道是牛旗，就像所有旗形一样，它们是通常向趋势方向突破的**延续模式**。然而，有时它们会向相反方向突破，导致**趋势反转**。突破是一种**急涨**，因此市场形成的不是**急涨通道趋势**，而是与**急涨通道模式**无关的**通道急涨趋势**。但通常**急涨**之后是通道。例如，如果存在熊市趋势并出现回调，该回调是一个上升通道，因此是一个熊旗。有时通道会向上突破。突破是一根看涨趋势K线和一个**急涨**，如果突破成功，**跟进动量**将是一个通道。牛市趋势始于该**急涨**，而该**急涨**及其后的通道形成**急涨通道型牛市趋势**。原始通道是熊市趋势的最终旗形，它向上突破，但它与随后的**急涨通道型牛市趋势**无关。**急涨**改变了市场，它是交易者新视角的开始，他们随后会忽略之前的熊旗。

---

### 楔形反转的失败与趋势的重置

类似情况发生在**楔形反转**失败时。例如，**楔形顶部**是一个上升的牛市通道，因此是一个熊旗，它通常向下突破。如果它反而向上突破，那么突破是一种**急涨**，并且可能随后是一个通道和一个**量度移动**上涨。**突破总是会重置心态**，应该被视为新趋势的开始。在这种情况下，趋势仍然是牛市趋势，就像楔形之前的趋势一样，但现在它是一个更强的牛市趋势。通常，上涨突破不会超过五到十根K线就会反转为持久的、两“腿”回调或反方向的趋势。它们代表着**极度高潮性**的、因此过度买入的行为。这处于行为**钟形曲线的尾部**，机构会有各种指标告诉他们牛市趋势过度并应该修正。每个机构都会依靠自己的过度衡量标准，但通常会有足够的机构认为反弹过度，他们的看跌押注很快就会压倒多头，反转随即发生。

---

### 急涨通道行为的普适性与复杂性

**急涨通道**行为是您在每个图表上都会看到的最常见也因此最重要的事物之一。它有无数种变体和对每种模式的多种解释。有时**急涨**会是一根K线，但随后，在暂停之后，会出现一个看起来更好的**急涨**。通道可能非常垂直，以至于它成为**急涨**的一部分，而**急涨通道**可能在更高时间框架上仅仅是一个**急涨**。该通道相对于**急涨**可能非常小或非常大。当趋势强劲时，通道内通常会有几个**急涨**，并且通道可以细分为更小的**急涨通道模式**。对所有可能性保持开放态度，因为它们都有潜力提供有利可图的**交易机会**。

>Sometimes a bull spike and channel can end with three pushes up, a trend channel line overshoot, and a strong bear reversal bar, but most reversals are not so straightforward. In Figure 21.1, bar 6 was part of a two-bar spike up but the move up from the bar 5 low was so steep that you can also consider bar 5 as the start of the spike. It does not matter because any strong reversal up on the open is likely to have follow-through buying, and there will be buy programs based on each. Here, it was in the form of a channel that had three pushes up and a wedge shape. Channels often pull back after a third push up. Bar 10 overshot the trend channel line and reversed down into a bear reversal bar, which set up a short trade. A bull wedge usually corrects in two legs down to around the bottom of the wedge, and a channel in a spike and channel bull usually corrects down in two legs to the start of the channel, which is also the bar 7 low.

![[Pasted image 20250707154231.png]]

>Spikes can be cumulative. The bar before bar 7 was a bear spike but it simply led to a test of the moving average. Bar 9 was a second bear spike. These two spikes indicate that the bears were trying to seize control over the market and that the market was becoming two-sided. Bar 10 was the first bar of a two-bar bear spike, and bar 11 was followed by another bear spike.Just because that final spike broke below the wedge and clearly led to the bear leg does not mean that it turned the market all by itself. Those earlier spikes were also part of the transition and shouldnot be overlooked. As they were forming, you should understand that the market was telling you that it was in transition and you should begin to look for trades in both directions and not just buy setups.


>Bar 16 was a one-bar spike but the spike up also can be considered to have begun with bar 15.There was a pullback to bar 17 and then three small pushes up to bar 21, where the market reversed.


>The bar after 15 is a one-bar spike, and the four bars that followed formed a small channel,ending at bar 16; the entire move up to 16 was also a spike.

>Bar 22 was a spike down and it corrected sideways to bar 25, where a channel began down to bar 27, which was the third push down after the spike (bars 23 and 26 were the first two), and bar 27 overshot the trend channel line and closed in its middle. That was not a strong signal bar and neither was the bear inside bar that followed, but the market reversed up into the close.

##### 牛市急涨通道的结束与反转信号

有时，牛市**急涨通道**可能会以三次上涨、一次**趋势通道线超调**和一根强劲的看跌反转K线结束，但大多数反转并不那么直接。

在图21.1中，第6根K线是两K线**急涨**的一部分，但从第5根K线低点开始的上涨如此陡峭，您也可以将第5根K线视为**急涨**的起点。这并不重要，因为开盘时任何强劲的上涨反转都可能带来**跟进买盘**，并且每种情况都会有买入程序支持。这里，它以一个具有三次上涨和**楔形**的通道形式出现。通道通常在第三次上涨后回调。第10根K线**超调**了**趋势通道线**并反转下跌，形成一根看跌反转K线，从而建立了做空**交易机会**。牛市**楔形**通常会**两“腿”下跌**修正到**楔形**底部附近，而**急涨通道型牛市**中的通道通常会**两“腿”下跌**修正到通道起点，也就是第7根K线低点。

---

##### 累积的急涨与市场过渡

**急涨**可以是累积的。第7根K线之前的那根K线是一个看跌**急涨**，但它仅仅导致了对移动平均线的测试。第9根K线是第二次看跌**急涨**。这两次**急涨**表明空头正在试图掌控市场，并且市场正在变得**双向**。第10根K线是两K线看跌**急涨**的第一根K线，第11根K线之后是另一次看跌**急涨**。仅仅因为最后一次**急涨**跌破了**楔形**并明确导致了看跌“腿”，并不意味着它独自扭转了市场。那些早期的**急涨**也是市场过渡的一部分，不应被忽视。当它们形成时，您应该明白市场正在告诉您它处于过渡期，您应该开始寻找双向交易，而不仅仅是买入**交易机会**。

---

##### K线形态与市场走势分析

第16根K线是一根单K线**急涨**，但上涨**急涨**也可以被认为是始于第15根K线。第17根K线处有一次回调，然后是三次小幅上涨到第21根K线，市场在此反转。

第15根K线之后的那根K线是一根单K线**急涨**，随后的四根K线形成了一个小型通道，结束于第16根K线；上涨到16根K线的整个走势也是一次**急涨**。

第22根K线是一次下跌**急涨**，它横盘修正到第25根K线，在那里一个通道开始下跌到第27根K线，这是**急涨**（第23和26根K线是前两次）后的第三次下跌，第27根K线**超调**了**趋势通道线**并收盘在其中间。那不是一个强劲的信号K线，随后的看跌内包K线也不是，但市场反转上涨直到收盘。

深入谈图表略过

>Some form of a spike and channel trend is present every day. In Figure 21.2, the first day,March 28, was a bear spike and channel day that began with a spike up but reversed into a three-bar spike down from bar 2 and then again from bar 3. There, it attempted to form a double bottom with the swing low at the end of the prior day. Either of the two large bear trend bars between bars 2 and 4 could also be considered the initial spike of the bear trend.Bar 8 formed a double top with the top of the small bear flag that followed bar 6, and then the market drifted down in a tight channel all day, with several good short entries near the moving average.

![[Pasted image 20250707154415.png]]

>The market broke above the channel on the next day with the spike up to bar 17. Since the start of the channel usually gets tested, traders could now start to look for long setups for a test of the bar 5 area. The bar 5 start of the bear channel was tested by bar 23 and exceeded by the bar 27 gap up on the following day.

>The channel down to bar 15 became slightly parabolic (it broke below the bear trend channel line from bar 9 to bar 11, indicating that the slope of the decline increased), which is climactic behavior and therefore not sustainable long-term. Traders could have also created the trend channel line by taking a parallel of the bar 5 to bar 8 trend line, and then anchoring it to the bar 6 or 7 low. Bars 13 and 15 would have overshot that line as well.


>During the sell-off, the bears scale into shorts and scalp for every conceivable reason. For example, they might sell on every two-point bounce or above the highof the previous bar, like above bar 9 and above the high of each of the five bars that followed bar 9 and had a high above the high of the prior bar. They would short at the moving average and at the trend line, like at bar 10. They would short on every tiny break above the trend line,like at bar 11. They would also short below the low of every pullback bar, like below the low of bar 10. Other bears will short on a fixed amount below every test of the top of the channel, like one or two points down after the test, betting that the downward momentum will have follow-through. Since this bear trend will be evident on every other small time frame and every other type of chart, traders will be shorting based on those charts as well, and on higher time frame charts.


>Aggressive bulls would be buying in that same bear channel. Some will be buying for scalps,like maybe at every test of the trend channel line, like at the bar 13 and bar 15 lows. Others will be scaling in, believing that the market should test the bar 8 or bar 10 top of the channel either today or tomorrow. They might buy every test of the trend channel line and every new swing low. For example, they might have limit orders to buy as the market fell below the bar 11 low during the spike down to bar 13. They might buy at the low, a few ticks lower, or a couple of points lower. Others will buy at the first sign that the sell climax down to bar 13 is stalling. They would see the smaller bear body and the large tail as a sign of exhaustion and therefore likely to be followed by a tradable rally. Some traders will scale in with larger positions, like two to three times the size of the prior position. Some will buy on a stop two points above the low, seeing a bounce of that size as a sign that the reversal in underway.Others will be trading off smaller and larger time frame charts or charts based on ticks or volume. The sell-off might be a pullback to the 60 minute or daily moving average, or to a strong bull trend line on a higher time frame chart. There are traders both buying and selling for every conceivable reason and scaling in and out using every imaginable approach. They can all make money if they know what they are doing. For most traders, however, it is risky to scale into longs in a bear channel in the final couple of hours of the day. They will too often find themselves holding a large losing position that they will be forced to exit before the close with a loss. Traders are more likely to make a profit in a bear channel if they look for short setups rather than trying to scale into longs, especially in the final couple of hours of the day.



>The spike up to bar 17 was followed by a wedge-shaped channel up to bar 23, and then a pullback, and then a large gap up on the next day. That gap up move might still be part of the channel up. Any gap is also a spike, and it can then be followed by another channel.


>The move down from bar 8 to bar 9 was also a spike, and the bear channel from bar 10 to bar 15 was retraced by the rally to bar 21. The move down from the double top bear flag created by bars 10 and 21 ended at bar 22, which was also a test of the moving average. A strong bear move should not be expected since there has been a trend reversal into a bull trend and the move up to bar 21 was strong. Seven of the prior eight bars had bull bodies and trending highs, lows, and closes.

##### 急涨通道趋势的普遍性与图21.2分析

某种形式的**急涨通道趋势**每天都会出现。在图21.2中，第一天，即3月28日，是一个**熊市急涨通道日**。它始于一次上涨**急涨**，但随后从第2根K线开始反转为三K线下跌**急涨**，然后从第3根K线再次下跌。在那里，它试图与前一天结束时的摆动低点形成**双重底**。在第2根K线和第4根K线之间的两根大型看跌趋势K线中的任何一根，也可以被视为熊市趋势的初始**急涨**。第8根K线与第6根K线之后的小型熊旗顶部形成**双重顶**，然后市场全天在紧密通道中缓慢下跌，在移动平均线附近有几个不错的做空**交易机会**。

---

##### 通道突破与测试

第二天，市场随着上涨**急涨**到第17根K线，突破了通道。由于通道的起点通常会得到测试，交易者现在可以开始寻找做多**交易机会**，以测试第5根K线区域。第5根K线所代表的熊市通道起点被第23根K线测试，并被随后一天第27根K线的跳空高开所超越。

---

##### 抛物线走势与交易行为

从第9根K线到第11根K线，下跌到第15根K线的通道略微呈现**抛物线形**（它跌破了从第9根K线到第11根K线的看跌**趋势通道线**，表明跌幅的斜率增加了），这是一种**高潮行为**，因此无法长期持续。交易者也可以通过取第5根K线到第8根K线趋势线的平行线，然后将其固定到第6或第7根K线低点来创建**趋势通道线**。第13和第15根K线也会**超调**该线。

在抛售过程中，空头会因为各种可以想象到的原因**分批做空**和**剥头皮交易**。例如，他们可能会在每反弹两点时卖出，或者在之前K线高点上方卖出，例如在第9根K线上方，以及在第9根K线之后高点高于前一根K线高点的五根K线中的每一根上方卖出。他们会在移动平均线和趋势线处做空，就像在第10根K线处。他们会在每次微小突破趋势线上方时做空，就像在第11根K线处。他们还会在每个回调K线低点下方做空，例如在第10根K线低点下方。其他空头会在每次测试通道顶部下方固定数量（例如测试后下跌一到两个点）做空，押注下行动量将有**跟进**。由于这种看跌趋势将在所有其他小时间框架和所有其他类型的图表上显而易见，交易者也会基于这些图表和更高时间框架图表进行做空。

---

##### 逆势交易的风险与顺势交易的优先

激进的多头也会在同一个熊市通道中买入。有些人会为了**剥头皮交易**而买入，例如在每次测试**趋势通道线**时买入，就像在第13和第15根K线低点处。其他人会**分批加仓**，认为市场应该在今天或明天测试第8或第10根K线通道顶部。他们可能会买入每一次测试**趋势通道线**和每一个新的摆动低点。例如，在市场下跌到第13根K线期间跌破第11根K线低点时，他们可能会有**限价单**买入。他们可能会在低点买入，或再低几个跳动点，或再低两三个点。其他人会在看跌高潮下跌到第13根K线出现停止迹象时买入。他们会将较小的看跌实体和长影线视为**竭尽**的迹象，因此很可能随后出现可交易的反弹。一些交易者会以更大的头寸**分批加仓**，例如是先前头寸的两到三倍大小。有些人会在低点上方两点处市价买入，将这种幅度的反弹视为反转正在进行的迹象。其他人会根据更小和更大时间框架图表，或基于跳动点或成交量的图表进行交易。抛售可能是回调到60分钟或日线移动平均线，或更高时间框架图表上的强劲牛市趋势线。有交易者因为各种可以想象到的原因买卖，并使用各种可以想象到的方法**分批进出**。如果他们知道自己在做什么，他们都能赚钱。然而，对于大多数交易者来说，在交易日最后几个小时，在熊市通道中**分批做多**是有风险的。他们太常会发现自己持有一个巨大的亏损头寸，被迫在收盘前亏损出场。如果交易者寻找做空**交易机会**而不是试图**分批做多**，特别是在交易日最后几个小时，他们在熊市通道中盈利的可能性更大。

---

##### 价格走势与趋势反转的信号

上涨到第17根K线的**急涨**之后是一个**楔形通道**，一直到第23根K线，然后是回调，再然后是第二天的跳空高开。这次跳空高开走势可能仍然是上涨通道的一部分。任何跳空也是一个**急涨**，随后可以再出现一个通道。

从第8根K线到第9根K线的下跌也是一次**急涨**，从第10根K线到第15根K线的看跌通道被反弹到第21根K线所回撤。由第10和第21根K线形成的**双重顶熊旗**之后的下跌走势在第22根K线结束，这也是对移动平均线的测试。由于趋势已经反转为牛市趋势，并且上涨到第21根K线的走势很强劲，不应预期会有强劲的看跌走势。之前八根K线中有七根具有看涨实体和趋势高点、低点和收盘价。

深入谈图表略过

>IBM had several spike and channel days on the 5 minute chart in Figure 21.3, and some were nested, with larger ones subdividing into smaller ones, which is common. Since the start of the channel often gets tested within a day or two, make sure to consider countertrend setups even on the next day. Each of the channel beginnings (bars 2, 5, and 8) was tested except the last one (bar 12). Bar 13 tried to begin the sell-off to test bar 12, but it instead it quickly failed and reversed up strongly.

![[Pasted image 20250707154601.png]]

>The spike up to bar 1 was followed by a nearly vertical and slightly parabolic move up to bar 3instead of a typical channel. This is a variant of a spike and channel trend. This also happened with the spike up to bar 11 and the channel up from bar 12. When channels are this steep, they usually are spikes on higher time frame charts.


>The rally to bar 3, from either bar 2 or the low of the chart, was so steep that it was a large spike. In fact, it formed a four-bar bull spike on the 60 minute chart, and was followed by a large, two-legged pullback that ended at bar 10 (bar 6 was the end of the first leg). The market rallied for the next two weeks to almost an exact measured move up (at $128.83, which was equal to about the height of the low of the chart to the top of bar 3, added to the high of bar 3).


>Although the spike down to bar 7 appears to be the obvious choice for the start of the bear leg,there was another interpretation and both probably influenced the market. Notice the large spike down on the open of May 5. Although the market rallied to a nominal higher high, this bear spike was very important and can be considered the spike that led to the channel down.The higher high might have been simply a higher high pullback from the bear spike and can be viewed as the start of the bear channel.

---

##### IBM的急涨通道日：嵌套与测试

在图21.3中，IBM在5分钟图上出现了多个**急涨通道日**，其中一些是嵌套的，更大的趋势细分为更小的趋势，这是很常见的。由于通道的起点通常会在一两天内得到测试，因此即使在第二天，也要确保考虑**逆势交易机会**。除了最后一个（第12根K线）之外，每个通道的起点（第2、5、8根K线）都得到了测试。第13根K线试图开始下跌以测试第12根K线，但它却迅速失败并强劲反转上涨。

---

##### 垂直通道与更高时间框架的关联

上涨到第1根K线的**急涨**之后是一个近乎垂直且略带**抛物线**形的上涨，一直到第3根K线，而不是典型的通道。这是**急涨通道趋势**的一种变体。上涨到第11根K线的**急涨**以及从第12根K线开始的上涨通道也发生了这种情况。当通道如此陡峭时，它们通常在更高时间框架图上是**急涨**。

---

##### 强劲反弹与量度移动目标

从第2根K线或图表低点到第3根K线的反弹非常陡峭，以至于它是一个大型**急涨**。事实上，它在60分钟图上形成了一个四K线牛市**急涨**，随后是一个大型的两“腿”回调，结束于第10根K线（第6根K线是第一“腿”的结束）。市场在接下来的两周内反弹，几乎精确地达到了一个**量度移动目标**（在128.83美元，大约等于从图表低点到第3根K线顶部的高度，再加上第3根K线的高点）。

---

##### 熊市腿的起点：多种解读

尽管下跌到第7根K线的**急涨**似乎是看跌“腿”的明显起点，但还有另一种解读，并且两者可能都影响了市场。请注意5月5日开盘时的大型下跌**急涨**。尽管市场反弹到了一个名义上的更高高点，但这次看跌**急涨**非常重要，可以被视为导致通道下跌的**急涨**。更高的高点可能仅仅是看跌**急涨**后的更高高点回调，并且可以被视为看跌通道的开始。

---

>Figure 21.4 is a close-up of the prior chart that illustrates the parabolic nature of the channel.The move from bars 8 to 9 was in a steep micro channel but the market broke above the channel and formed an even steeper bull channel from bars 10 to 11. This increase in the slope creates a parabolic shape, which is unsustainable and therefore a type of climax.However, a climax can last longer than you can sustain your account, so never look to short such a strong bull trend, even though you know it cannot last indefinitely.

![[Pasted image 20250707154635.png]]

>Although it did not seem likely, the market tested below the low of the beginning of the channel at bar 3 on the following day.

>Whenever a market starts to develop about 10 or more strongly trending bars with little overlap and small tails, it is in a very strong trend and traders are buying it at the market. Why are they not waiting for a pullback? Because they are so certain that prices will be higher very soon and they are not certain that there will a pullback soon, so they don't wait for a pullback that might not come. Even if there is a pullback, they are confident that it will be shallow and last only a few bars before there is a new high.


>The move from bar 1 to bar 2 is a spike and climax trend. Bar 1 is the spike, but instead of a channel, the market created a second spike at bar 2. Consecutive climaxes are usually followed by a deeper pullback, often to the bottom of thesecond climax, as it did here. Since this is exactly what spike and channels do, a spike and climax should be thought of as another type of spike and channel trend.


>Although the move from bar 7 to bar 11 was a micro channel, it was tight enough so that traders expected it to be a spike on a higher time frame chart. The entire move from bar 3 to bar 15 was tight enough to be a spike as well. In fact, the market pulled back to near the bottom of the spike over the next three days. This was followed by a seven-day bull channel that reached a measured move up, based on the height of the spike.


>The move up from bar 12 to bar 14 was in a channel, and it was followed by a spike breakout consisting of two bull trend bars to the bar 15 high. Here, there is a spike following a channel,which is sometimes the case in a spike and climax variant of a spike and channel pattern. The spike is the channel up to bar 14 and the channel is the spike up to bar 15, and the combination behaves like a traditional spike and channel pattern.


>As strong as the three-bar bull spike up to bar 21 was, on a small enough time frame—for example, a 10 tick chart—it was almost certainly a tight channel, as are most spikes.
---

##### 图21.4：通道的抛物线特性与高潮行为

图21.4是前一张图表的特写，它展示了通道的**抛物线性质**。从第8根K线到第9根K线的走势发生在一个陡峭的微型通道中，但市场突破了该通道，并从第10根K线到第11根K线形成了甚至更陡峭的牛市通道。这种斜率的增加形成了一个**抛物线形**，这是不可持续的，因此是一种**高潮**。然而，一个**高潮**可以持续的时间比您的账户所能承受的时间还要长，所以绝不要尝试做空如此强劲的牛市趋势，即使您知道它不能无限期地持续下去。

---

##### 市场对通道起点的测试

尽管看起来不太可能，市场在第二天测试了第3根K线（通道起点）的低点下方。

---

##### 强势趋势的特征与交易者的行为

每当市场开始形成大约10根或更多根**趋势强劲**、**重叠度小**且**影线短小**的K线时，它就处于一个非常强劲的趋势中，交易者正在**市价买入**。为什么他们不等待回调？因为他们非常确定价格很快会更高，而且不确定很快会有回调，所以他们不等待可能不会出现的回调。即使有回调，他们也相信它会很浅，并且只持续几根K线就会创出新高。

---

##### 急涨与高潮趋势的解读

从第1根K线到第2根K线的走势是**急涨高潮趋势**。第1根K线是**急涨**，但市场没有形成通道，而是创建了第二个**急涨**在第2根K线处。**连续高潮**通常会伴随着更深度的回调，通常会回到第二个**高潮**的底部，就像这里发生的那样。由于这正是**急涨通道模式**的行为方式，因此**急涨高潮**应该被视为另一种类型的**急涨通道趋势**。

---

##### 微型通道与更高时间框架的急涨

尽管从第7根K线到第11根K线的走势是一个微型通道，但它足够紧凑，交易者预期它在更高时间框架图表上会是一个**急涨**。从第3根K线到第15根K线的整个走势也足够紧凑，可以看作是一个**急涨**。事实上，市场在接下来的三天内回调到**急涨**底部附近。随后是一个七天的牛市通道，其上涨幅度达到了基于**急涨**高度的**量度移动目标**。

---

##### 通道后的急涨与模式变体

从第12根K线到第14根K线的上涨发生在一个通道中，随后是一个由两根看涨趋势K线组成的**急涨突破**，到达第15根K线高点。这里，**急涨**出现在通道之后，这有时是**急涨通道模式**的**急涨高潮变体**的情况。通道是上涨到第14根K线，**急涨**是上涨到第15根K线，这种组合的行为类似于传统的**急涨通道模式**。

---

##### 小型时间框架下的急涨本质

尽管上涨到第21根K线的三K线牛市**急涨**非常强劲，但在足够小的时间框架（例如10个跳动点图表）上，它几乎肯定是一个**紧密通道**，就像大多数**急涨**一样。

---

深入谈图表略过

>Sometimes a gap can be the spike, forming a gap spike and channel day (see Figure 21.5). The chart on the left is the S&P cash index, and you can see that the gap up on the Emini chart on the right was just a large bull trend bar and therefore a spike up on the cash index. Therefore,it makes sense to consider a gap on the Emini as just a large trend bar.
>The bar 2 start of the channel was tested on the next day (bar 4). The channel up to bar 3 was losing momentum and began to curve downward as it rounded over at the top.
---

##### 跳空开盘：作为急涨的特殊情况

有时，一个**跳空（gap）** 本身就可以成为**急涨（spike）**，形成一个**跳空急涨通道日（gap spike and channel day）**（参见图21.5）。左侧的图表是标准普尔现金指数，您可以看到右侧Emini图表上的**跳空高开**在现金指数上只是一根大型的看涨趋势K线，因此是一个**上涨急涨**。因此，将Emini上的跳空视为一根大型趋势K线是合理的。

---

##### 通道起点的测试与动量减弱

通道的起点（第2根K线）在第二天（第4根K线）得到了测试。上涨到第3根K线的通道正在失去**动量（momentum）**，并在顶部**圆弧顶**时开始向下弯曲。

>Sometimes the market just keeps forming a series of spikes, and the channels are so steep that they become spikes on a higher time frame chart (see Figure 21.6). The 5 minute Eminichart on the right had many spikes up, and the channel from bars 8 to 10 was so steep that there was no pullback that tested the beginning of the channel. Instead, the entire spike and channel pattern up to bar 10 was just a spike on the 60 minute chart on the left. Bar 10 on the 60 minute chart corresponds to bar 10 on the 5 minute chart. The 60 minute chart then formed a channel up to bar 12 and the market corrected back to the bottom of the 60 minute channel by bar 13.

>Although the three-bar spike from bar 4 to bar 5 formed the clearest spike of the day on the 5minute chart, there were several other spikes, like bars 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9, and all had the possibility of being followed by a channel up. The three-bar move down to bar 8 was a spike down, and it could have led to a channel down to test the start of either of the channels up from bars 4 or 6, but the bull trend was so strong that it was simply a 20 gap bar buy signal leading to a protracted channel up.

##### 连续急涨与高时间框架下的形态

有时市场会持续形成一系列**急涨（spikes）**，并且通道非常陡峭，以至于在更高时间框架图上它们就变成了**急涨**（参见图21.6）。右侧的5分钟Emini图上出现了多次上涨**急涨**，从第8根K线到第10根K线的通道非常陡峭，以至于没有任何回调测试通道的起点。相反，从第8根K线到第10根K线的整个**急涨通道模式**在左侧的60分钟图上仅仅是一个**急涨**。60分钟图上的第10根K线对应着5分钟图上的第10根K线。随后，60分钟图形成了一个上涨到第12根K线的通道，并且市场在第13根K线处回调到60分钟通道的底部。

---

##### 5分钟图上的多个急涨与交易机会

尽管从第4根K线到第5根K线的三K线**急涨**在5分钟图上形成了当天最清晰的**急涨**，但还有其他几个**急涨**，例如第2、3、6、7和9根K线，并且所有这些都有可能随后形成上涨通道。下跌到第8根K线的三K线走势是一个下跌**急涨**，它本可以导致一个下跌通道，以测试从第4或第6根K线开始的任何一个上涨通道的起点，但牛市趋势如此强劲，以至于它仅仅是一个20**缺口K线买入信号**，导致了一个持久的上涨通道。

>As shown in Figure 21.7, strong spikes don't always appear to lead to channels, like the spike down to bar 2 or the spike up to bar 9. However, trends almost always begin with some spike,even though it might be easy to overlook. Sometimes, spikes and channels look very different on higher and lower time frame charts, but you do not need to look at them if you can infer what they show from what you can see on the 5 minute chart. What at first glance appears to be a big spike might in fact, on a smaller time frame, be a spike and channel that is so steep that it is easy to miss the channel. Conversely, what appears to be a steep spike and channel might be simply a spike on a higher time frame chart.

![[Pasted image 20250707154954.png]]

>The move down from bar 1 to bar 2 looks like a spike but the market instead saw bar 1 as a spike and the next four bars down to bar 2 as a channel, which was probably much easier to see on a smaller time frame chart. The entire move down to bar 2 can also be viewed as a spike down that was followed by a pullback to a higher high at bar 9, and then the channel down began. Sometimes the pullback from the spike goes beyond the start of the spike before the channel begins.


>The first part of that channel down was a spike from bar 9 to bar 11, which was followed by a channel down from bar 14 to bar 18. Also, the gap before bar 10 together with bar 10 itself formed a spike down, and then the move down to bar 11 was a channel.

>Once you understand how to see the subtleties of spike and channel patterns, you will adjust your assessment of probabilities of your potential trades, and you will also find many more trading opportunities.

##### 急涨与通道的隐藏形态

如图21.7所示，强劲的**急涨（spike）** 并非总是明显地直接导致通道，例如下跌到第2根K线的**急涨**或上涨到第9根K线的**急涨**。然而，趋势几乎总是以某种**急涨**开始，尽管它可能很容易被忽视。有时，**急涨**和通道在更高和更低的时间框架图表上看起来非常不同，但如果您能从5分钟图上推断出它们所显示的内容，则无需查看它们。乍一看似乎是一个大**急涨**的走势，在更小的时间框架上，实际上可能是一个非常陡峭的**急涨通道**，以至于通道部分很容易被错过。反之，看起来像是一个陡峭的**急涨通道**，在更高时间框架图上可能仅仅是一个**急涨**。

---

##### 价格走势的多重解读

从第1根K线到第2根K线的下跌看起来像一个**急涨**，但市场却将第1根K线视为一个**急涨**，并将随后的四根K线（一直到第2根K线）视为一个通道，这在更小的时间框架图上可能更容易看出。从第1根K线到第2根K线的整个下跌走势也可以被视为一个下跌**急涨**，随后回调到第9根K线的更高高点，然后下跌通道开始。有时，从**急涨**的回调会超出**急涨**的起点，然后通道才开始。

---

##### 复杂的通道结构与交易机会

该下跌通道的第一部分是从第9根K线到第11根K线的**急涨**，随后是从第14根K线到第18根K线的下跌通道。此外，第10根K线之前的跳空与第10根K线本身共同形成了一个下跌**急涨**，然后下跌到第11根K线的走势是一个通道。

一旦您理解了如何观察**急涨通道模式**的微妙之处，您将调整对潜在**交易机会**概率的评估，并且您还会发现更多的**交易机会**。

>Consecutive climaxes create a variant of a spike and channel trend pattern. Every large trend bar should be thought of as a breakout, a spike, and a climax. In Figure 21.8, bar 3 was a large bear trend bar in a bear trend, and it was a sell climax. However, a climax does not mean that the market will reverse. It simply means that it went too far, too fast, and it might pause for one or more bars. The trend can then resume, or the market could go sideways or even reverse.

![[Pasted image 20250707155036.png]]

>This climax was corrected by a one-bar pause, which was a bear inside bar, and was then followed by bar 4, another sell climax. Bar 4 was followed by a three-bar correction and then a third consecutive sell climax that marked the low of the bear trend. This final sell climax was the two-bar move down to the bar 5 low. It does not matter that the bars are strong bear bars with large bodies, small tails, and little overlap. A climax usually leads to a correction. These traders were desperate to sell and could not take the chance of waiting for a bounce that would allow them to sell at a better price. Once these weak traders have sold, there is no one left who wants to sell and this leaves the buyers in control, lifting the market. There was a one-bar correction after the bar 3 climax, a three-bar correction after the bar 4 climax, and a major reversal after the bar 5 climax. Usually when there are two consecutive climaxes, there is at least a two-legged correction. When there are three, the reversal is generally even larger,as it was here.


>Since consecutive climaxes are a variant of spike and channel trends, you can think of bar 3 as a spike and bar 4 as a channel, even though there is no series of small overlapping bars with tails as you would see in a typical channel. Then bar 4 became a spike for the channel down to bar 5.


>Bar 6 was a bull spike that ended with the bar 8 channel. The move up to bar 8 was so steep that bars 6 to 8 could have been considered a spike, and they probably formed a spike on a higher time frame chart. Bars 7 to 10 formed a channel after the bar 6 spike. At this point, the breakout gap created by the bar 6 spike had two breakout points, the top of the small rally after bar 4 and the high of the bar before bar 6. Different traders have put more emphasis on one over the other, but both were important. Bar 11 was a test of the bottom of the channel and therefore a test of the gap. This made bar 11a breakout test, and as usual it formed a double bottom bull flag with the bar 7 or bar 9 start of the bull channel. Once the market started moving up again, the bulls would not have wanted it to test back down. If it did, they would have seen that as a sign of weakness and the chance of a strong move up would have been greatly reduced.

>Bar 10 was at the end of a four-bar parabolic move up. If you connect the highs of the consecutive bars from bar 9 through bar 10, the line created would have a parabolic shape. Its slope increased two bars after bar 9 and decreased between the final two bars. The channel from bar 7 to bar 10 was so steep that the move from bar 6 to bar 10 was probably a spike on a higher time frame chart.

>Bar 12 ended a two-bar spike and bar 15 ended a parabolic channel.
>Bars 7 through 15 created a larger channel with three pushes.
>Bar 17 was a three-bar spike, and it was followed by a parabolic channel up to bar 18.
>The three-bar spike down to bar 19 was followed by a small channel down to bar 22. Bars 21and 22 formed a small spike and a second sell climax (the move to bar 19 was the first) and were therefore likely to lead to a correction up.

##### 连续高潮与急涨通道趋势的变体

**连续高潮（consecutive climaxes）** 创造了**急涨通道趋势模式**的一种变体。每一根大型趋势K线都应该被视为一次**突破（breakout）**、一次**急涨（spike）** 和一次**高潮（climax）**。

在图21.8中，第3根K线是熊市趋势中的一根大型看跌趋势K线，它是一次**卖出高潮**。然而，**高潮**并不意味着市场会反转。它仅仅表示市场走得太远、太快，并且可能会暂停一根或多根K线。然后趋势可以恢复，或者市场可能横盘整理，甚至反转。

---

##### 高潮的修正与反转

这次**高潮**被一根K线的暂停所修正，这是一个看跌**内包K线（inside bar）**，随后是第4根K线，另一次**卖出高潮**。第4根K线之后是三K线修正，然后是第三次**连续卖出高潮**，这标志着熊市趋势的低点。这次最终的**卖出高潮**是下跌到第5根K线低点的两K线走势。K线是强劲的看跌K线，具有大型实体、小影线和很少重叠，但这并不重要。**高潮**通常会导致修正。这些交易者急于卖出，不能冒险等待反弹以更高的价格卖出。一旦这些弱势交易者卖出，就没有人愿意卖出，这使得买方掌握控制权，推高市场。在第3根K线**高潮**后有一次单K线修正，在第4根K线**高潮**后有一次三K线修正，在第5根K线**高潮**后有一次主要反转。通常当出现两次**连续高潮**时，至少会有**两“腿”修正**。当有三次**连续高潮**时，反转通常会更大，就像这里一样。

---

##### 连续高潮的另一种解读

由于**连续高潮**是**急涨通道趋势**的变体，您可以将第3根K线视为**急涨**，将第4根K线视为通道，尽管没有像典型通道那样一系列小幅重叠带影线的K线。然后第4根K线成为下跌到第5根K线的通道的**急涨**。

---

##### 牛市急涨与通道的形成

第6根K线是一次牛市**急涨**，结束于第8根K线通道。上涨到第8根K线的走势非常陡峭，以至于第6到第8根K线可以被视为一次**急涨**，而且它们可能在更高时间框架图上形成了一个**急涨**。第7到第10根K线在第6根K线**急涨**后形成了一个通道。此时，由第6根K线**急涨**造成的**突破跳空（breakout gap）** 有两个突破点：第4根K线之后小幅反弹的顶部以及第6根K线之前K线的高点。不同的交易者对其中一个或另一个有更多的侧重，但两者都很重要。第11根K线是对通道底部的测试，因此也是对跳空的测试。这使得第11根K线成为一个**突破测试（breakout test）**，并且像往常一样，它与第7或第9根K线开始的牛市通道形成**双重底牛旗（double bottom bull flag）**。一旦市场再次开始上涨，多头就不希望它再次回落测试。如果真的回落，他们会将其视为弱势迹象，强劲上涨的可能性将大大降低。

---

##### 抛物线形通道与更高时间框架的急涨

第10根K线结束了一次四K线**抛物线形**上涨。如果您连接从第9根K线到第10根K线的连续K线高点，形成的线将呈现**抛物线形**。它的斜率在第9根K线之后两根K线增加，并在最后两根K线之间减小。从第7根K线到第10根K线的通道非常陡峭，以至于从第6根K线到第10根K线的走势在更高时间框架图上可能是一个**急涨**。

---

##### 持续的急涨与修正

第12根K线结束了一次两K线急涨，第15根K线结束了一个抛物线形通道。

第7根到第15根K线创建了一个包含三次推动的更大通道。

第17根K线是一次三K线急涨，随后是抛物线形上涨到第18根K线。

下跌到第19根K线的三K线急涨之后是一个小型下跌通道，一直到第22根K线。第21和第22根K线形成了一个小型急涨和第二次卖出高潮（下跌到第19根K线的走势是第一次），因此很可能导致上涨修正。
