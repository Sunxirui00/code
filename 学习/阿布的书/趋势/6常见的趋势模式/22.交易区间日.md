>Primary characteristics of trending trading range days:
>• The opening range is about a third to half the size of the range of recent days.
>• There is a breakout after an hour or two and then the market forms another trading range.
>• Because there are trading ranges, there are usually opportunities to take trades in both directions.
>• There sometimes are multiple breakouts and trading ranges, but when this happens, it is usually better to consider the day as a stronger type of trend day and trade only with trend.
>• After the second trading range begins to form, there is usually a pullback that tests the earlier trading range.
>• The test often breaks back into the earlier range. When it comes close to but does not penetrate the prior range, the trend is a little stronger.
>• Sometimes the market goes all the way through the earlier range and the day becomes a reversal day.
>• Most reversal days begin as trending trading range days.
>• When the breakout is very strong, the day is more likely to become a weak spike and channel trend.
##### **趋势性交易区间日**的主要特征：

- **开盘区间**：开盘区间大约是近期日波动范围的三分之一到一半大小。
- **突破与新交易区间**：开盘后一到两个小时会有一个**突破**，随后市场会形成另一个**交易区间**。
- **双向交易机会**：由于存在**交易区间**，通常会有机会在两个方向进行交易。
- **多重突破与交易区间**：有时会出现多个**突破**和**交易区间**，但当这种情况发生时，通常最好将当天视为一种更强劲的趋势日，并且只进行**顺势交易**。
- **回调测试**：在第二个**交易区间**开始形成后，通常会有一个回调，测试早期的**交易区间**。
- **回测旧区间**：测试通常会重新回到早期的区间内。当它接近但未穿透前期区间时，趋势会稍微强劲一些。
- **反转日**：有时市场会完全穿过早期的区间，当天就会变成一个**反转日**。
- **反转日的起始**：大多数**反转日**都始于**趋势性交易区间日**。
- **强劲突破**：当突破非常强劲时，当天更有可能成为一个弱势的**急涨通道趋势**。

>Since every trend has pullbacks and they are small trading ranges, some form of a trending trading range day is present during every trend day, and the trending trading ranges are the dominant features at least a couple of times each week. If the opening range is about a third to half of the size of the recent average daily range,then look for a breakout and an approximate doubling of the range of the day. These trend days are made of a series of usually two, or occasionally more, trading ranges separated by brief breakouts, and the formations are sometimes not readily seen as trading ranges.However, on the daily chart, the day is clearly a trend day, opening near one end of the bar and closing near the other. Whenever the market is creating trending swings but the day does not look like a clear trend day, it is probably a trending trading range day. Also, if the day's range in the first hour or two is only about a third to half of the average range of recent days,watch for a breakout and an approximate measured move, and then a second trading range forming over the rest of the day. This type of trend is present in some form several days each week but is often better classified as another type of trend or even a large trading range.

>Many days can be classified as either spike and channel trend days or trending trading range days, depending on their strength. The stronger the trend, the more the day will behave like a spike and channel trend day. The reason to try to distinguish between them is that they should be traded differently. When a day is more of a spike and channel trend day, it is a strong trend, and traders should focus on with-trend trades and swing trades. They should avoid countertrend trades unless there is a clear transition into a trading range or an opposite trend. When the day is more of a trending trading range day, traders can usually take trades in both directions and look for more scalps. As a day is forming, there are clues that tell traders if the breakout is more likely to lead to a strong trend day, like a spike and channel trend day (or even a small pullback trend day), or to a trending trading range day. Trading ranges are more common than strong trends, and trending trading range days, in particular, are about twice as common as spike and channel trend days, although every day has at least one spike and channel swing. The spike in a spike and channel trend day is most likely to begin early in the day, often from the first bar or with a large gap up or down. Also, it usually either breaks well beyond bars from yesterday or strongly reverses from a breakout, like a sharp rally from the first bar on a large gap down day. The spike in a trending trading range day is a breakout from a trading range, but it is usually still within the range of the prior day.

>The opening trading range often lasts one to three hours and can be about half of the size of an average day's range. This lack of urgency is a sign that the day is less likely to become a strong trend day. Also, the initial trading range has a magnetic pull, as does any trading range,and that works against the breakout going too far before pulling back and forming another trading range. The breakout on a spike and channel trend day is often large and fast. The spike can have three or more large bull trend bars with small tails and very little overlap. On a trending trading range day, the spike is usually just one to three bars, and they tend to be smaller and have larger tails and more overlap. If the pullback is just a single bar and the breakout from the pullback is another spike, even if it is smaller and only a single bar, the day is more likely to be a spike and channel trend day. If the pullback goes sideways for five to 10bars, or if the breakout from the pullback is a weak channel with overlapping bars and trend bars in the opposite direction, the day is more likely to be a trending trading range day. If the pullback after the spike is strong enough to make traders uncertain of the always-in direction,a trading range is more likely than a trend channel, so look for scalps instead of swings.

>Entering on the breakout of any trading range is a low-probability trade, except in special circumstances, which are discussed in book 2 on trading ranges. It is usually much better to enter on a breakout pullback or on some earlier reversal from the opposite side of the range,but if a trader is confident that the day might be evolving into a trending trading range day and the breakout is strong, the trader can consider entering as the breakout bar is forming, or around the close of the breakout bar or on the close of the next bar, if it is also strong. The breakout spike is usually followed by a channel, but it will often stop around the measured move area, and then the market will begin to form a trading range. The market breaks out of one range and then forms another. Rarely, three or four small trading ranges will develop in a day, but when that happens, the day should probably be thought of and traded as a stronger type of trend day, like a spike and channel or a small pull-back trend day. Traders should focus much more if not exclusively on with-trend setups. If the market later pulls back into a prior range, it will often retrace all the way to the other side of that range. The implication is that the market consolidates in a range after the breakout. This means that there will be two-sided trading that tests both the top and bottom of the new range and possibly breaks out in either direction at some point. Once the market reaches the measured move area, it is likely to transition into a second trading range. Traders should then transition with it from trend style trading to trading range trading. For example, if the day is a bull trending trading range day,traders should take profits in the area that is approximately a measured move up, if the trend is weakening, based on the height of the lower trading range. This is because the market will then usually test down into the breakout area and then form a trading range.

>Traders should not trail their protective stops below a swing low once they think that the market is in a trending trading range, because those stops will usually get hit. It makes more sense to look to exit on strength when the market is forming an upper range, than to exit on weakness. Remember, in a trading range, traders should buy low, sell high. Aggressive traders will fade big trend bars in the area of the measured move target. For example, in a bull trending trading range day, once the market gets close to the measured move target, bears will look for a large bull trend bar. If one forms, they will often short its close or just above its high, and then scale into more shorts if the market goes higher. They expect that the large bull trend bar is an exhaustive buy climax, and that it will be followed by an eventual test down into the gap (the two or three bull trend bars forming a breakout from the lower trading range), and possibly to the top of the lower range. Since they are expecting an upper trading range to develop, shorting at the top of a bull spike in the area where the market is likely to form the top of the upper trading range gives them an excellent entry price. This is discussed more in the second book in the section on trading range trading. Even if the market goes higher, the odds are very strong that the market will come back below their entry price. If they scaled in higher, they could exit their first entry at breakeven, and then move the stop on their higher entry to breakeven, and hold for a test into the gap.

>Since there is two-sided trading throughout the day, it is common for the day to reverse through at least one of the trading ranges in the final hour or two of the day. Since each trading range has two-sided trading, it is a comfort zone for bulls and bears, who both see the area as value. This creates a magnetic pull and tends to draw breakouts back into the range.

>The importance of recognizing this type of trend day is that this reversal is a reliable countertrend trade, since the market will usually form a breakout test. Because of this, once the breakout reaches the approximate measured move target where trend traders will take profits, traders will watch for a trade in the opposite direction, looking to exit on the breakout test. Experienced traders will fade strong trend bars around the measured move area, looking for the pullback to test the breakout gap. For example, when the average daily range in the Emini is about 10 points, if there is a trading range for a couple of hours and then an upside breakout, strong bears will begin to scale into shorts at about four to six points above the lower range. They are looking for a pullback into the breakout area and maybe all the way back to the top of the lower trading range. If the market reverses back into the prior range, it will likely test the countertrend signal bars in the prior range. For example, if a bear trend reverses up, it will attempt to reach the high of prior failed bull signal bars. If the rally extends to the top or above the upper trading range and the day closes up there, the day will be a reversal day on the daily chart. The day sold off and then reversed up and closed near its high.Most reversal days begin as trending trading range days (the section on reversal days in the third book has examples), so whenever traders recognize that the day is a trending trading range day, they should always be prepared for a possible late reversal swing trade, which might become a large intraday trend trade that can cover the entire day's range.

>Trending trading range days often give a subtle clue that a breakout should be expected. If you see a trading range day forming, but each swing high is a little higher than the prior one and each swing low is higher than the prior one, the market may already be trending even though it is still in a trading range. Once enough participants recognize this, the market breaks out and quickly moves to a higher level, where it once again will become two-sided and form another trading range.

>When the initial breakout occurs, do not assume that a measured move is assured as the market tries to grow to an average daily range. In about a third of cases, the market will break out of one side and extend the range a little, and then reverse and break out of the opposite side and extend the range a little more, resulting in a quiet trading range day.

>Sometimes there is a trading range with a height that is about half of the recent average daily range and the range stays small until the final hour. For example, if the day's range in the Emini has been just five points as the market enters the final hour and the average recent range has been 12 points, and only two days in the past 12 months ended up with a range of five points or less, be prepared for a breakout at the end of the day. Every day has a range of five points at some point, if only for the first minute. Most trending trading range days with an initial range of only five points have a breakout within the first two or three hours, but several times a year the day will stay small until the final hour or two. When that happens, most of the time there will be a breakout that will increase the range, but usually not all the way up to the recent daily average. Don't give up on the day and assume that it will end up as only a five-point range day, because in 90 percent of the cases the range will increase before the close and you can often profitably trade the brief breakout. Because the breakout occurs so late,there is often not enough time left to form much of a trading range, but because the day appeared likely all day long to be a trending trading range day, it is appropriate to discuss it here.

##### 趋势日中的交易区间与波动模式

由于每个趋势都伴随回调，而这些回调本身就是小型的**交易区间**，因此，某种形式的**趋势性交易区间日**会出现在每一个趋势日中。事实上，**趋势性交易区间**每周至少有两次是市场的主要特征。如果**开盘区间**大约是近期平均日波动范围的三分之一到一半，那么就要留意**突破**，这通常会导致日波动范围大致翻倍。这些趋势日通常由两到（偶尔更多）个**交易区间**构成，它们之间由短暂的**突破**隔开。虽然这些形态有时不易被一眼识别为**交易区间**，但在日线图上，当天通常会清晰地表现为一个趋势日，开盘价接近K线的一端，收盘价接近另一端。每当市场形成趋势性摆动，但当天看起来不像一个明确的趋势日时，它很可能是一个**趋势性交易区间日**。此外，如果一天中前一两个小时的波动范围仅约为近期平均波动范围的三分之一到一半，那么请关注**突破**和大约的**量度移动**，随后在当天剩余时间形成第二个**交易区间**。这种类型的趋势每周会以某种形式出现好几天，但通常最好将其归类为另一种趋势类型，甚至是大型**交易区间**。

---

##### 强弱趋势的区分与交易策略

许多日子可以根据其强度被归类为**急涨通道趋势日**或**趋势性交易区间日**。趋势越强，当天就越会表现得像**急涨通道趋势日**。区分它们的原因在于它们应该采用不同的交易策略。当一天更倾向于**急涨通道趋势日**时，这是一个强劲的趋势，交易者应专注于**顺势交易**和**波段交易**。他们应该避免**逆势交易**，除非市场明确过渡到**交易区间**或相反趋势。当一天更像是一个**趋势性交易区间日**时，交易者通常可以在两个方向进行交易并寻求更多的**剥头皮交易机会**。随着一天的形成，会有线索告诉交易者**突破**更可能导致强劲的趋势日（如**急涨通道趋势日**，甚至**小幅回调趋势日**），还是**趋势性交易区间日**。**交易区间**比强劲趋势更常见，特别是**趋势性交易区间日**大约是**急涨通道趋势日**的两倍，尽管每天至少有一个**急涨通道型摆动**。在**急涨通道趋势日**中，**急涨**最有可能在一天早期开始，通常从第一根K线开始，或者伴随着大幅度的跳空高开或低开。此外，它通常要么显著突破昨天K线的范围，要么从**突破**中强劲反转，例如在一个大幅跳空低开的日子里，第一根K线出现急剧反弹。在**趋势性交易区间日**中，**急涨**是**交易区间**的**突破**，但它通常仍在前一天的范围内。

---

##### 开盘区间、突破特点与日内形态判断

**开盘交易区间**通常持续一到三个小时，大约是平均日波动范围的一半大小。这种缺乏紧迫性表明当天不太可能成为一个强劲的趋势日。此外，初始**交易区间**（如同任何**交易区间**）都具有磁性吸引力，这会阻碍**突破**在回调并形成另一个**交易区间**之前走得太远。**急涨通道趋势日**上的**突破**通常规模大且速度快。**急涨**可以有三根或更多大型看涨趋势K线，影线小且重叠很少。在**趋势性交易区间日**上，**急涨**通常只有一到三根K线，而且它们往往更小，影线更大，重叠更多。如果回调只是一根K线，并且从回调中再次出现**突破**，即使它更小且只有一根K线，当天也更可能成为**急涨通道趋势日**。如果回调横盘整理五到十根K线，或者如果从回调中出现的**突破**是一个带有重叠K线和反向趋势K线的弱通道，当天更有可能成为**趋势性交易区间日**。如果**急涨**之后的回调足够强劲，以至于交易者对“总是处于”的方向不确定，那么**交易区间**比趋势通道更有可能，所以寻找**剥头皮交易机会**而不是**波段交易机会**。

---

##### 交易区间突破后的策略与获利了结

在任何**交易区间**的**突破**处入场都是低概率交易，特殊情况除外（详见关于**交易区间**的第二本书）。通常最好在**突破回调**时入场，或者在区间另一侧的早期反转时入场。但如果交易者确信当天可能正在演变为**趋势性交易区间日**且**突破**强劲，则可以考虑在**突破K线**形成时入场，或在**突破K线**收盘时，或在下一根K线收盘时入场（如果它也很强劲）。**突破急涨**通常会伴随着通道，但它通常会在**量度移动**区域附近停止，然后市场将开始形成一个**交易区间**。市场突破一个区间，然后形成另一个。很少有一天会发展出三到四个小型**交易区间**，但当这种情况发生时，当天可能应该被视为并以更强劲的趋势日进行交易，例如**急涨通道**或**小幅回调趋势日**。交易者应该更大幅度地（如果不是完全地）专注于**顺势交易机会**。如果市场随后回调进入先前的区间，它通常会完全回撤到该区间的另一侧。这意味着**突破**之后市场会在一个区间内进行**盘整**。这意味着将有双向交易，测试新区间顶部和底部，并可能在某个时候向任一方向突破。一旦市场达到**量度移动**区域，它很可能过渡到第二个**交易区间**。交易者也应该随之从趋势型交易过渡到**交易区间**交易。例如，如果当天是牛市**趋势性交易区间日**，如果趋势正在减弱，交易者应该在约**量度移动**上涨的区域内获利了结，这基于较低**交易区间**的高度。这是因为市场随后通常会向下测试**突破区域**，然后形成一个**交易区间**。

---

##### 止损管理与激进交易者的策略

一旦交易者认为市场处于**趋势性交易区间**，就不应将**保护性止损**跟踪在摆动低点下方，因为这些止损通常会被触发。当市场形成上方区间时，在强势时退出比在弱势时退出更有意义。记住，在**交易区间**中，交易者应该**低买高卖**。激进的交易者会在**量度移动目标**区域**逆势交易**大型趋势K线。例如，在牛市**趋势性交易区间日**中，一旦市场接近**量度移动目标**，空头就会寻找一根大型看涨趋势K线。如果形成一根，他们通常会在其收盘时或其高点上方做空，如果市场走高，则**分批做空**更多。他们预计大型看涨趋势K线是**竭尽**的**买入高潮**，随后最终会向下测试**跳空**（形成较低**交易区间突破**的两到三根看涨趋势K线），并可能测试较低区间的顶部。由于他们预期会形成一个上方**交易区间**，在市场可能形成上方**交易区间**顶部的区域做空牛市**急涨**，给了他们一个极好的入场价格。这在第二本书关于**交易区间**交易的部分有更多讨论。即使市场走高，市场回到他们入场价下方的可能性也非常大。如果他们**分批加仓**更高，他们可以以盈亏平衡点退出他们的第一个入场，然后将更高入场的止损移至盈亏平衡点，并持有以测试**跳空**。

---

##### 尾盘反转与磁性吸引

由于全天都有双向交易，当天在最后**一两个小时**内反转穿过至少一个**交易区间**是很常见的。由于每个**交易区间**都有双向交易，它是多头和空头的舒适区，两者都将该区域视为价值区。这会产生磁性吸引力，并倾向于将**突破**拉回区间。

---

##### 识别趋势性交易区间日的重要性与后期交易机会

识别这种趋势日的重要性在于，这种反转是一个可靠的**逆势交易**机会，因为市场通常会形成**突破测试**。因此，一旦**突破**达到**量度移动目标**（趋势交易者会在此获利了结），交易者就会观察相反方向的交易，并寻求在**突破测试**时退出。经验丰富的交易者会在**量度移动**区域附近**逆势交易**强劲的趋势K线，寻找回调以测试**突破跳空**。例如，当Emini的平均日波动范围约为10点时，如果有一个持续几个小时的**交易区间**，然后出现向上**突破**，强劲的空头会开始在低于较低区间约四到六点处**分批做空**。他们正在寻找回调到**突破区域**，甚至可能一直回到较低**交易区间**的顶部。如果市场反转回之前的区间，它很可能会测试先前区间内的**逆势信号K线**。例如，如果熊市趋势向上反转，它将尝试达到先前失败的牛市信号K线的高点。如果反弹延伸到上方**交易区间**的顶部或上方，并且当天收盘在那里，那么当天在日线图上将是一个**反转日**。当天先下跌，然后反转上涨并收盘在其高点附近。大多数**反转日**都始于**趋势性交易区间日**（第三本书中关于**反转日**的部分有例子），因此每当交易者认识到当天是一个**趋势性交易区间日**时，他们都应该随时准备好可能的**尾盘反转波段交易机会**，这可能会成为一个大型日内趋势交易，可以覆盖全天的波动范围。

---

##### 趋势性交易区间日的细微线索与后期突破

**趋势性交易区间日**通常会给出一个微妙的线索，预示着**突破**即将到来。如果您看到一个**交易区间日**正在形成，但每个摆动高点都比前一个高点略高，并且每个摆动低点都比前一个低点高，那么市场可能已经在趋势运行，即使它仍然处于**交易区间**内。一旦足够多的参与者认识到这一点，市场就会突破并迅速移动到更高的水平，在那里它将再次变为双向并形成另一个**交易区间**。

---

##### 初始突破后的不确定性与平静交易区间日

当初始**突破**发生时，不要假设**量度移动**是确定的，因为市场试图扩大到平均日波动范围。在大约三分之一的情况下，市场会从一侧突破并略微扩大范围，然后反转并从相反一侧突破并略微扩大更多范围，从而导致一个平静的**交易区间日**。

---

##### 尾盘突破的交易机会与风险

有时，**交易区间**的高度约为近期平均日波动范围的一半，并且该区间一直保持较小，直到最后几个小时。例如，如果Emini的日波动范围在市场进入最后几个小时时仅为五点，而最近的平均范围为12点，并且在过去12个月中只有两天以五点或更小的范围结束，那么请准备好在收盘时出现**突破**。每一天在某个时候都会有五点的范围，哪怕只持续第一分钟。大多数初始范围只有五点的**趋势性交易区间日**会在前两到三个小时内出现**突破**，但每年会有几次，当天会一直保持较小直到最后**一两个小时**。当这种情况发生时，大多数情况下都会有一个**突破**会增加范围，但通常不会一直增加到近期日平均水平。不要放弃当天，假设它只会以五点范围日结束，因为在90%的情况下，范围会在收盘前增加，而且您通常可以从短暂的**突破**中获利。由于**突破**发生得很晚，通常没有足够的时间形成太多的**交易区间**，但由于当天全天看起来都像是一个**趋势性交易区间日**，所以在这里讨论它是恰当的。


>Trending trading range days often have a single large trend bar in between the ranges. In Figure 22.1, the market was in a trading range for the final couple of hours of yesterday from bar 1 to bar 3, and the trading range continued through the first couple of hours of today. Bar 10 was a large bull trend bar that broke out of the trading range and above the wedge top formed by bars 5, 7, and 9. The next bar was a bull trend bar, and it confirmed the breakout (it significantly increased the chance of higher prices and some kind of measured move up). The market immediately entered a small trading range for the rest of the day.
>That range continued into the third day. Any trading range has a magnetic pull on the market,and this makes most breakout attempts fail. The trading range from bar 11 to bar 19 was the final bull flag in the rally, and the breakout to bar 21 failed. The market then broke below this upper trading range with the large bar 22 bear trend bar. The sell-off tested the top of the range from the prior day and formed another trading range. Bar 29 was a failed breakout of the top of the lower range and a third push up, and the pull of the lower range was greater than that of the upper range. The market traded back through the lower range, tested the bottom at bar 32, and then closed near the top of the lower trading range.
>The bull spike from bar 8 to bar 13 was large but the follow-through channel from bar 12 to bar 17 was disproportionally small. The breakout gap in between thebar 9 top of the lower trading range and the bar 12 bottom of the upper trading range was large compared to the height of the upper range. This increased the chances that the market would come back into the gap to test its strength. The trading range from bar 23 to bar 33 was mostly within that breakout gap between bar 9 and bar 12, which often happens.
>The initial range from bar 4 to bar 9 was about half the size of an average day. So traders expected the range to approximately double. When there is a trading range that is about half of the size of an average daily range, the most common way that the range increases is by a breakout and the formation of a trending trading range day.The third day's opening range from bar 19 to bar 21 was about a third of the size of an average day, and traders expected a breakout. Since they also expected a test into the gap of the prior day, a downside breakout was likely, and it followed the failed attempt to break out of the top of the range. The spike down to bar 23 was strong and it was possible that the day could have become a spike and channel bear trend day, but bar 23 tested the support provided by yesterday's trading range (the highs of bars 3, 5, and 7). It was about a measured move down,and it also tested a three-day trend line (not shown). This means that the sell-off might have simply been a sell vacuum created by strong bulls and bears stepping aside until the market fell down to the support zone, at which point they bought aggressively. The bull spikes up from bars 23, 25, and 26; the double bottom bull flag created by the spikes in between bars 25and 26; and the double bottom pullback at bar 28 all represented increasing buying pressure,and the market even flipped to always-in up on the spike up to bar 29. This is not what typically happens in the pullback after a spike in a spike and channel bear trend day, and this made a trending trading range more likely. If this was to become a spike and channel bear trend day, the pullback from the bar 23 spike would not typically have much buying pressure compared to the strength of the bear spike. The uncertainty created by the buying pressure increased the chances of a trading range instead of a brief pullback and then a protracted bear channel. Uncertainty is the hallmark of trading ranges and not of bear flags (a pullback leading to a bear channel).
>The distinction between a spike and channel trend day and a trending trading range day is not always clear and sometimes not important. Although the trading range that began at bar 12made the day a trending trading range day, it also had higher lows and highs and therefore was a weak bull channel. Remember, a channel is just a sloped trading range and both are areas of two-sided trading. The less sloped it is, the more it behaves like a trading range and the more safely traders can trade in both directions.

##### 区间之间的单根大趋势K线与磁性引力

**趋势性交易区间日**通常在各个**交易区间**之间夹带一根大型趋势K线。在图22.1中，市场在昨天最后几个小时（从第1根K线到第3根K线）处于一个**交易区间**，并且这个**交易区间**持续到了今天的前几个小时。第10根K线是一根大型的**牛市趋势K线**，它突破了**交易区间**，并越过了由第5、7和9根K线形成的**楔形顶部**。下一根K线也是一根**牛市趋势K线**，它确认了**突破**（这显著增加了价格上涨和某种**量度移动**上涨的机会）。市场随即在当天剩余时间进入了一个小的**交易区间**。

---

##### 交易区间的延续与突破失败

该区间一直持续到第三天。任何**交易区间**都对市场具有磁性吸引力，这使得大多数**突破尝试**都以失败告终。从第11根K线到第19根K线的**交易区间**是这次上涨中的最后一个**牛旗**，并且上涨到第21根K线的**突破**失败了。随后，市场以大型的第22根K线**熊市趋势K线**跌破了这个上方**交易区间**。这次抛售测试了前一天区间的顶部，并形成了另一个**交易区间**。第29根K线是下方区间顶部的一次失败**突破**和第三次上涨推动，下方区间的吸引力大于上方区间。市场交易回到了下方区间内，在第32根K线处测试了底部，然后收盘在下方**交易区间**的顶部附近。

---

##### 急涨与通道的比例关系及跳空测试

从第8根K线到第13根K线的**牛市急涨**很大，但从第12根K线到第17根K线的**跟进通道**却不成比例地小。在第9根K线（较低**交易区间**的顶部）和第12根K线（上方**交易区间**的底部）之间的**突破跳空**相对于上方区间的高度来说是很大的。这增加了市场回调进入**跳空**以测试其强度的可能性。从第23根K线到第33根K线的**交易区间**大部分位于第9根K线和第12根K线之间的那个**突破跳空**内，这种情况经常发生。

---

##### 初始区间与后续走势预期

从第4根K线到第9根K线的初始区间大约是平均日波动范围的一半。因此交易者预期范围会大约翻倍。当**交易区间**大约是平均日波动范围的一半时，范围扩大的最常见方式是通过**突破**和形成一个**趋势性交易区间日**。第三天的**开盘区间**从第19根K线到第21根K线，大约是平均日波动范围的三分之一，交易者预期会有一个**突破**。由于他们也预期会测试前一天的**跳空**，因此下跌**突破**是可能发生的，它发生在向上突破区间顶部失败尝试之后。下跌到第23根K线的**急涨**很强劲，并且当天有可能成为一个**急涨通道型熊市日**，但第23根K线测试了昨天**交易区间**提供的支撑（第3、5和7根K线的高点）。它大约是一个**量度移动**下跌，并且还测试了三日趋势线（未显示）。这意味着抛售可能仅仅是由强劲的多头和空头退居一旁，直到市场跌至支撑区而造成的**卖出真空**，此时他们积极买入。从第23、25和26根K线开始的**牛市急涨**；由第25和26根K线之间的**急涨**形成的**双重底牛旗**；以及第28根K线处的**双重底回调**都代表着买盘压力的增加，市场甚至在上涨到第29根K线处的**急涨**时转为“总是处于上涨”。这与**急涨通道型熊市日**中**急涨**后的回调通常情况不同，这使得**趋势性交易区间**更有可能。如果这要成为一个**急涨通道型熊市日**，那么第23根K线**急涨**后的回调通常不会有太多的买盘压力，与**熊市急涨**的强度相比。买盘压力造成的不确定性增加了出现**交易区间**的可能性，而不是短暂回调和随后的持久熊市通道。不确定性是**交易区间**的标志，而不是**熊旗**（导致**熊市通道**的回调）的标志。

##### 趋势日分类的模糊性与交易原则

**急涨通道趋势日**与**趋势性交易区间日**之间的区别并不总是清晰的，有时也不重要。尽管从第12根K线开始的**交易区间**使当天成为一个**趋势性交易区间日**，但它也有更高的高点和低点，因此是一个弱势牛市通道。请记住，通道只是一个倾斜的**交易区间**，两者都是双向交易的区域。斜率越小，它越像一个**交易区间**，交易者就可以越安全地在两个方向进行交易。

>As shown in Figure 22.2, for the first couple of hours of both days, the range was about half that of the recent days. This alerted traders to a possible breakout in either direction. When the breakout starts later in the day like this, without a clear direction in the opening range,and the initial range is about half that of an average day, the breakout usually does not result in a strong, relentless trend, like a spike and channel trend. Instead, it usually has a pullback and then the market forms a lower trading range. The lower range may or may not break back into the upper range, and may sometimes break out again to the downside and form a third or fourth trading range. Since a lower trading range is more likely than a strong bear trend, the trading should be two-sided and the market usually works its way back to the breakout area.Once the breakout extends below the breakout point for about a third of an average range,traders will start looking to buy for a swing up to the bottom of the upper range. They would have bought the second attempt to reverse up above bar 11 and above bar 28. They also would have bought the double bottom at bar 5 and the higher low at bar 29.
>Once the market breaks back into the upper range and holds up there, it often tests up near the top of the upper range, as it did on the second day. If the day closes near the top or above the upper range, the day becomes a reversal day. Aggressive bulls would have bought the close of the large bear trend bar beforebar 27, expecting it to be an exhaustive sell climax that would lead to a test up to the bottom of the upper trading range. Some would have bought on limit orders at a measured move down from the height of the upper trading range. They would have counted the number of points between the top of bar 22 down to the bottom of bars 21 or 25, and then subtracted that number from the low of bars 21 or 25. They would have then begun to scale in around that price level, maybe starting a point or two above to a few points below. Others would have bought at the first sign of two-sided trading, like the close of bar 27, or as bar 27 was reversing off its low. Assuming that the average daily range was about 10 points, some bulls would have scaled in at four to six points below the bar 25 bottom of the upper range, looking to make three to six points on the pullback into the breakout gap (the bear trend bars below bar 25).
>Although the sell-off from bar 19 to bar 21 was sharp, so was the rally up to bar 22. This led to enough uncertainty about the direction in the opening range to reduce the chances of a spike and channel trend day and increase the chances of a trending trading range day.

##### 初始区间与突破预期

如图22.2所示，在这两天的前几个小时，波动范围大约是近期日波动范围的一半。这提醒交易者注意可能出现的双向**突破**。当**突破**在盘中后期才开始，且**开盘区间**没有明确方向，并且初始区间大约是平均日波动范围的一半时，**突破**通常不会导致强劲、无情的回调趋势，比如**急涨通道趋势**。相反，它通常会伴随一次回调，然后市场形成一个较低的**交易区间**。这个较低的区间可能会或可能不会重新回到上方区间，有时甚至可能再次向下突破并形成第三或第四个**交易区间**。由于形成较低**交易区间**的可能性大于强劲的熊市趋势，因此交易应该是双向的，市场通常会回到**突破区域**。一旦**突破**向下延伸，超出**突破点**大约平均范围的三分之一时，交易者就会开始寻找买入**交易机会**，进行向上摆动，目标是上方区间的底部。他们会在第11根K线和第28根K线上方第二次尝试向上反转时买入。他们也会在第5根K线处的**双重底**和第29根K线处的更高低点买入。

---

##### 区间回测与反转日判断

一旦市场回升到上方区间并保持在那里，它通常会向上测试上方区间的顶部附近，就像第二天那样。如果当天收盘在上方区间的顶部附近或上方，当天就变成了**反转日**。激进的多头会在第27根K线之前的大型看跌趋势K线收盘时买入，预期它是一次**竭尽**的**卖出高潮**，将导致向上测试上方**交易区间**的底部。有些人会以**限价单**在上方**交易区间**高度的**量度移动**下跌处买入。他们会计算第22根K线顶部到第21或25根K线底部之间的点数，然后从第21或25根K线的低点减去该点数。然后他们会开始在该价格水平附近**分批加仓**，可能从高出一两个点到低几个点不等。其他人会在出现双向交易的第一个迹象时买入，例如第27根K线收盘时，或者第27根K线从低点反转时。假设平均日波动范围约为10点，一些多头会在低于第25根K线（上方区间底部）四到六点处**分批加仓**，希望在回调到**突破跳空**（第25根K线下方的看跌趋势K线）中获得三到六个点。

---

##### 早期不确定性对趋势类型的影响

尽管从第19根K线到第21根K线的抛售非常剧烈，但上涨到第22根K线的反弹也同样剧烈。这导致了**开盘区间**方向的足够不确定性，从而降低了出现**急涨通道趋势日**的可能性，并增加了出现**趋势性交易区间日**的可能性。

>Sometimes a day can spend most of its time in trading ranges but still be a trend day. As shown in Figure 22.3, today may not look like a trend day, but it is, as can be seen in the thumbnail of the daily chart (today is bar 1), and it is made up of a series of trending small trading ranges. These days frequently reverse in the final couple of hours and retrace at least the final trading range.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>Some days do not have reliable setups for an hour or more. In Figure 22.3, today opened at aflat moving average within the range of the final bar of yesterday, which had been in a small trading range, and that range continued for the first two bars of today's open. The first two bars of today were large compared to the height of the trading range, and this makes them risky signal bars. Although shorting below the second bar was acceptable since it was a two-bar reversal short setup and a wedge bear flag below the moving average, the entry would be near the low of the trading range. It was safer to wait for the breakout and then short a breakout pullback, if there was one. One developed a few bars later but it was in a small, tight trading range and the bars had big tails, makingit a less reliable trade. A better entry was below the 8:00 a.m. PST two-bar reversal and pullback to the moving average, which was a low 2 short.
>There was a moving average gap bar short at 11:45 and the test of the bear low was in the form of a higher low. It is also appropriate to call it a double bottom bull flag.
>This was a trending trading range day, so once it started to base around the $185 level, traders could have bought in that area for a test of the bottom of the upper range just above $186. The market made a two-legged sell-off down to the $185 level and the second leg was an approximate measured move. The middle of the morning trading range was about $2.00below the high of the day and the large two-bar reversal at 10:15 a.m. was about $2.00 lower,so traders would start buying. The bears were buying back some of their shorts and the bulls were buying for a test of the bottom of the upper trading range. The market entered a tight trading range and there were three small pushes down that ended with a large bear trend bar at 11:05. This was followed by a higher low at 11:30, and the signal bar had a bull body. This higher low was also a high 2 since the bar before it and the bar two bars before that had bear bodies. This is microscopic analysis and most traders would not trust this in real time, but experienced traders are always looking for signs that the market might turn, and these subtle hints would help give them confidence to take the long. If they bought above the 11:30 low,they could risk about 50 cents to below that low with the goal of making about a dollar on the test of the upper trading range.Although you never know the directional probability of an equidistant move with certainty,whenever you feel that there is an imbalance, you should assume that it is at least 60 percent.Here, it was reasonable to assume that if you bought around $185, there was at least a 60percent chance that the test of $186 would happen before your protective stop was hit if you placed that stop equidistantly below your entry (there is a 60 percent chance that you would make a dollar before you lost a dollar). You could have taken a partial profit on the doji inside bar after the bull spike up at 11:40 and exited the rest at breakeven as the breakout failed.Once the market double bottomed at 12:25, you could try the same long again and you would have succeeded. There was a chance of a measured move up to a $2.00 profit from the double bottom, but with so little time left in the day, this was unlikely.

##### 盘整趋势日：表象与本质

如图22.3所示，今天可能看起来不像一个趋势日，但实际上它是一个趋势日，这可以从日线图的缩略图中看出（今天对应第1根K线）。它由一系列**趋势性小型交易区间**构成。这类日子经常在最后几个小时内反转，并至少回撤最后一个**交易区间**。

---

##### 盘面深度分析：入场时机与风险考量

有些日子在开始的一小时甚至更长时间内没有可靠的**交易机会**。在图22.3中，今天开盘时**移动平均线**平坦，位于昨天最后一根K线的范围内，而昨天也处于一个小的**交易区间**中，这个区间延续到了今天开盘的前两根K线。今天的前两根K线相对于**交易区间**的高度来说是很大的，这使得它们成为有风险的**信号K线**。尽管在第二根K线下方做空是可以接受的（因为它是一个两K线反转做空**交易机会**，并且是**移动平均线**下方的**楔形熊旗**），但入场点会接近**交易区间**的低点。更安全的选择是等待**突破**，然后如果有**突破回调**再做空。几根K线后确实出现了一个，但它在一个小型、紧密的**交易区间**内，并且K线带有长影线，使其成为一个不太可靠的交易。一个更好的入场点是在太平洋时间上午8:00的两K线反转和回调到**移动平均线**下方，这是一个**低2做空**。

---

##### 交易机会：移动平均线与双重底

在11:45有一个**移动平均线缺口K线做空**，而熊市低点的测试以更高低点的形式出现。称其为**双重底牛旗**也是恰当的。

---

##### 盘整趋势日的买入策略与概率评估

这是一个**趋势性交易区间日**，所以一旦它开始在185美元左右筑底，交易者就可以在该区域买入，目标是测试略高于186美元的上方区间底部。市场经历了**两“腿”下跌**，跌至185美元，第二“腿”大约是一个**量度移动**。上午**交易区间**的中点大约比当天高点低2.00美元，而上午10:15的大型两K线反转大约低2.00美元，所以交易者会开始买入。空头正在回补部分空头头寸，而多头正在买入，目标是测试上方**交易区间**的底部。市场进入一个紧密的**交易区间**，出现了三次小幅下跌，最终在11:05形成了一根大型看跌趋势K线。随后在11:30出现了一个更高低点，并且**信号K线**带有看涨实体。这个更高低点也是一个**高2**，因为它的前一根K线和再前两根K线都带有看跌实体。这是微观分析，大多数交易者在实时交易中不会信任这一点，但经验丰富的交易者总是在寻找市场可能转向的迹象，这些微妙的线索将帮助他们获得信心进行做多。如果他们在11:30低点上方买入，他们可以冒险约50美分（止损设在该低点下方），目标是在测试上方**交易区间**时获利约一美元。尽管您永远无法确定等距移动的方向性概率，但每当您感到存在**不平衡**时，您都应该假设它至少有60%的概率。在这里，假设您在185美元左右买入，并且将**保护性止损**等距放置在入场点下方（您赚取一美元之前损失一美元的概率为60%），那么测试186美元至少有60%的机会发生，这是合理的。您可以在11:40牛市**急涨**后的**十字星内包K线**上部分获利了结，并在**突破**失败时以盈亏平衡点退出剩余头寸。一旦市场在12:25形成**双重底**，您可以再次尝试同样的做多，并且会成功。从**双重底**处有达到2.00美元利润的**量度移动**的机会，但由于当天所剩时间不多，这种可能性不大。

>As shown in Figure 22.4, this was another trending trading range day with the first trading range beginning yesterday. The thumbnail of the daily chart shows it was a bear trend day (bar 1).
>The final trading range reversed up and the market tested near the top of the higher trading range just before it. This often happens, since the two-sided trading means that the trending forces are not as strong as they are during other trend days. When a day is less strong, it is less likely to close on its low. Traders know this and look for a reversal trade going into the close.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In Figure 22.4, today again opened essentially unchanged and near a flat moving average.However, the three-bar bear spike made a bear trend day likely. The spike broke below the trading range that formed in the final hour of yesterday. That trading range was also a two-legged rally and therefore a bear flag, so the breakout can be thought of as a breakout below the bull trend line along the bottom of the bear flag. Traders could short below the first pullback and then again below the moving average test, which was also a two-legged sideways correction to the moving average and an approximate double top bear flag setup.

##### 盘整交易区间日的特点与反转

如图22.4所示，这是又一个**趋势性交易区间日**，第一个**交易区间**从昨天开始。日线图的缩略图显示，这是一个**熊市趋势日**（第1根K线）。

最后一个**交易区间**向上反转，市场测试了紧邻其上方的**交易区间**顶部附近。这种情况经常发生，因为双向交易意味着趋势力量不像其他趋势日那样强劲。当一天的趋势较弱时，它不太可能收于最低点。交易者知道这一点，并在临近收盘时寻找反转**交易机会**。

---

##### 盘面深度分析：开盘与做空机会

在图22.4中，今天再次基本持平开盘，并接近平坦的**移动平均线**。然而，三K线**熊市急涨**使得当天很可能成为**熊市趋势日**。这次**急涨**跌破了昨天最后一小时形成的**交易区间**。那个**交易区间**也是一个**两“腿”上涨**，因此是一个**熊旗**。所以，这次**突破**可以被认为是跌破了**熊旗**底部沿线的**牛市趋势线**。交易者可以在第一次回调下方做空，然后再次在**移动平均线测试**下方做空。**移动平均线测试**也是一个**两“腿”横向修正**到**移动平均线**，并且大约是一个**双重顶熊旗交易机会**。

---

>As shown in Figure 22.5, the first hour was contained in a seven-point range but the average range lately had been about 20 points, so traders expected the range to approximately double. Whenever a trend begins after an hour into the day, the day often becomes a trending trading range day, in part because by definition that first hour obviously was a trading range.The day often reverses back into and sometimes through one or more of the lower trading ranges late in the day, as it did here.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>When the day is forming multiple trending trading ranges as in Figure 22.5, traders should concentrate on taking with-trend trades. Traders should have looked to buy only from the two-bar reversal at bar 2 to the 20 gap bar high 2 at bar 9. They should have considered shorting only at the bar 1 0 final flag reversal setup.
>Many bulls would have taken profits on their longs, and aggressive bears would have shorted on the close and above the high of the bull trend bar before bar 10. The market had a spike up to bar 3 and then a channel or a series of small trading ranges, but the one that began at bar 8was relatively tight and horizontal. This was an area of strong two-sided trading, and therefore a magnet that would tend to draw the marketback in after a breakout. The market also often retraces into the prior trading range later in the day, and since 11:30 a.m. PST is a common time for reversals, the odds of a failed breakout and final flag reversal were high. The pullback could have tested the bar 4 start of the bull channel, so bears were happy shorting at the high of a large bull trend bar breakout above a swing high and potential final flag. Many would have scaled into more shorts higher, believing that the market had a 70 percent chance or better of at least testing their first short entry price before the close. This would have enabled them to exit their original shorts at breakeven and decide whether to exit their shorts from above with a profit or to move the protective stops to breakeven and swing the trade down.
>Bar 2 was the first bar of a two-bar reversal up from a possible failed low 2 from a double or triple bottom, and the start of a bull trend. Traders were aware that the market could break out and run. Once the market broke out, it formed a higher range from bars 4 to 6, and that range contained two small tight trading ranges. The high 2 long above bar 5 was a reasonable breakout pullback entry, despite the barbwire. The breakout was both from the small bull flag from bar 3 to bar 4, and from the entire bar 3 to bar 5 trading range, which was a two-legged sideways pullback from the breakout above bar 1.
>The market broke out to a third range, from bars 8 to 9. When it broke out again, it failed at bar 10 (a final flag reversal) and retraced through the bottom of the third range and ultimately to the bottom of the second range. There was a breakout pullback short below bar 11 after the bear spike, but the barbwire made it more risky. After the two bear bars forming a spike that ended at bar 12, there was a second breakout pullback short below bar 13.
>The implication in the word range is that the market will test the low of the range at some point, although it could continue trading up. When a market retraces a strong move, the first target is always the earlier countertrend entry points. Here, the closest bear entry point after the market broke out of the top range was the low of the closest bear signal bar, bar 6. The market broke out of the top range, and then broke into the next lower range and took out that bear signal bar low on bar 13.
>By the close, the market had tested the low of the bar 3 lowest bear signal bar in the second range.

##### 开盘区间与趋势性交易区间日的特点

如图22.5所示，前一个小时的波动范围是七点，但近期平均波动范围约为20点，因此交易者预期范围会大致翻倍。当趋势在一天开始一个小时后才启动时，当天通常会成为**趋势性交易区间日**，部分原因在于这第一个小时本身就定义为一个**交易区间**。当天通常会在尾盘反转回并有时穿过一个或多个较低的**交易区间**，就像这里发生的那样。

---

##### 盘面深度分析：顺势交易机会的选择

当像图22.5那样，一天中形成多个**趋势性交易区间**时，交易者应该专注于进行**顺势交易**。交易者应该只考虑从第2根K线处的两K线反转到第9根K线处的20跳空K线**高2**做多。他们应该只考虑在第10根K线处的最终旗形反转**交易机会**做空。

---

##### 获利了结、反转交易与磁性区间效应

许多多头会了结多头头寸，激进的空头会在收盘时和第10根K线之前牛市趋势K线的高点上方做空。市场在第3根K线处出现**急涨**，然后是一个通道或一系列小型**交易区间**，但从第8根K线开始的那个相对紧密且横向。这是一个强劲的双向交易区域，因此是一个磁体，倾向于在**突破**后将市场拉回。市场也经常在当天晚些时候回撤到先前的**交易区间**内，由于太平洋时间上午11:30是常见的反转时间，因此**突破**失败和最终旗形反转的概率很高。回调可能会测试第4根K线处的牛市通道起点，因此空头乐于在大幅看涨趋势K线**突破**摆动高点和潜在最终旗形时做空。许多人会**分批做空**更多，相信市场在收盘前至少有70%或更高的机会测试他们的第一次做空入场价格。这将使他们能够以盈亏平衡点退出最初的空头头寸，并决定是获利退出上方入场的空头头寸，还是将**保护性止损**移至盈亏平衡点并继续**波段交易**。

---

##### 首次买入机会与后续突破

第2根K线是一个**两K线反转**的第一个K线，从可能的**双重底**或**三重底**形成的失败**低2**向上反转，并标志着牛市趋势的开始。交易者意识到市场可能会**突破**并快速上涨。一旦市场**突破**，它从第4根K线到第6根K线形成了一个更高的区间，该区间包含两个小型紧密**交易区间**。尽管有**带刺线**，但第5根K线上方的**高2做多**是一个合理的**突破回调**入场。这次**突破**既是来自从第3根K线到第4根K线的小型**牛旗**的**突破**，也是来自整个第3根K线到第5根K线**交易区间**的**突破**，这是一个从第1根K线上方**突破**后的**两“腿”横向回调**。

---

##### 第三次区间突破与交易机会

市场**突破**进入第三个区间，从第8根K线到第9根K线。当它再次**突破**时，在第10根K线处失败（一个最终旗形反转），并回撤穿过第三个区间的底部，最终到达第二个区间的底部。在看跌**急涨**后，第11根K线下方有一个**突破回调做空**，但**带刺线**使其风险更高。在形成**急涨**并结束于第12根K线的两根看跌K线之后，第13根K线下方有第二次**突破回调做空**。

---

##### 区间回测与反趋势交易机会

“区间”一词的含义是市场会在某个时候测试区间的低点，尽管它可能会继续向上交易。当市场回撤强劲走势时，第一个目标总是早期的**逆势入场点**。在这里，市场突破顶部区间后最近的看跌入场点是最近的看跌**信号K线**（第6根K线）的低点。市场突破顶部区间，然后突破进入下一个较低区间，并在第13根K线处跌破了那个看跌**信号K线**的低点。

---

##### 收盘前的测试

至收盘时，市场已经测试了第二个区间内第3根K线（最低的看跌**信号K线**）的低点。

>Although today (see Figure 22.6) opened on its high and closed on its low, and was a trend from the open bear trend day, there was too much sideways action during the first two hours for this to trade like one. A trend from the open trend day usually doesn't have many significant tradable countertrend swings, but a trending trading range does, and is a weaker,less predictable type of trend day. The initial trading range broke down into a lower range on bar 4, creating a trending trading range day.
>Until bar 3, the day's range was only about half that of recent days, so traders were aware of the possibility of a lower trading range forming.Bar 6 was a breakout pullback to the moving average and a breakout test of the bar 2 bottom of the upper range, offering a reasonable short entry.Bar 9 was a breakout test of the upper range and failed breakout of the top of this lower range,setting up another short.
>Bar 12 broke down into a third range, but there was not enough time left in the day for a test up to the bar 13 top of the range.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In Figure 22.6, yesterday closed below the moving average and today's open was a bull breakout above the close and moving average. The first bar of the day was a doji andtherefore not a reliable short signal bar. The bar 1 strong bear trend bar was a reasonable signal bar for a short one tick below its low for a test of the moving average and maybe the close of yesterday. Since large gap openings often lead to trends and this bear bar was a sign of urgency on the part of the bears, today could become a bear trend day and traders should short early and swing part until there is a strong bull reversal or until the close of the day.
>After the two-bar bear spike, traders were expecting a bear channel and began to short pullbacks. The first pullback short was the low 2 that was triggered by the outside down bar just after 7:00 a.m. PST, and the next short was below the bar 3 bear reversal bar. It was a dueling lines short setup, forming both a double top with the earlier pullback and a wedge bear flag (the first push up was two bars before bar 2).
>Bar 1 4 was a bull reversal bar, but it overlapped the prior two bars too much for it to be reliable. Also, it was within a relatively tight channel after the bar 12 bear spike, so it would be better to wait for a breakout pullback higher low before going long in a bear trend. Since it was a weak buy setup in a bull trend, its failure would likely be a good short setup. Bar 15 was failed high 2, and a low 2 with a bear reversal bar near the moving average in a bear trend is a very high-probability short setup because the bulls who bought the high 1 and the high 2trend reversal attempts usually exit on a low 2. The market just made two attempts to reverse the new low of the day, and this second one failed on the bar after the bar 15 long. When the market fails twice at trying to do something, it usually then goes in the opposite direction.

![[Pasted image 20250710223938.png]]
##### **开盘即趋势日**的变体与交易区间

尽管今天（参见图22.6）开盘即是高点，收盘即是低点，并且是一个**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势日**，但在前两个小时内有太多的横向波动，使其不像典型的**开盘即趋势日**那样交易。一个真正的**开盘即趋势日**通常不会有太多重要的可交易**逆势摆动**，但**趋势性交易区间日**则会，它是一种较弱、较不具可预测性的趋势日类型。初始**交易区间**在第4根K线处向下突破到较低区间，从而形成了一个**趋势性交易区间日**。

---

##### 早期区间与做空机会

直到第3根K线，当天的波动范围仅约为近期日波动范围的一半，因此交易者意识到可能会形成一个较低的**交易区间**。第6根K线是向**移动平均线**的**突破回调**，也是对第2根K线（上方区间底部）的**突破测试**，提供了一个合理的做空**交易机会**。第9根K线是对上方区间的**突破测试**，也是下方区间顶部的一次失败**突破**，这又设置了另一个做空**交易机会**。

---

##### 第三区间的形成与时间限制

第12根K线向下突破进入第三个区间，但当天所剩时间不足以测试到第13根K线（区间顶部）。

---

##### 盘面深度分析：开盘分析与早期做空

在图22.6中，昨天收盘在**移动平均线**下方，而今天开盘是一个**牛市突破**，高于昨天的收盘价和**移动平均线**。当天第一根K线是一个**十字星**，因此不是一个可靠的做空**信号K线**。第1根K线的强劲**熊市趋势K线**是一个合理的做空**信号K线**，低于其低点一个跳动点，目标是测试**移动平均线**，也可能是昨天的收盘价。由于大型**跳空开盘**通常会导致趋势，并且这根看跌K线是空头紧迫性的迹象，今天可能会成为一个**熊市趋势日**，交易者应该及早做空并**波段**持有部分头寸，直到出现强劲的牛市反转或直到收盘。

---

##### 熊市急涨后的回调做空机会

在两K线**熊市急涨**之后，交易者预期会形成一个**熊市通道**，并开始做空回调。第一次回调做空是上午7:00（太平洋时间）之后由**外包下跌K线**触发的**低2**，下一次做空是在第3根K线**熊市反转K线**下方。这是一个**对峙线做空**“交易机会”，既与早期的回调形成了**双重顶**，又形成了**楔形熊旗**（第一次上涨推动在第2根K线前两根K线）。

---

##### 弱势买入机会的失败与高概率做空

第14根K线是一根**牛市反转K线**，但它与前两根K线重叠太多，使其不可靠。此外，在第12根K线**熊市急涨**之后，它处于一个相对紧密的通道中，因此在熊市趋势中，最好等待**突破回调**后的更高低点再做多。由于它在牛市趋势中是一个弱势买入**交易机会**，它的失败很可能会成为一个很好的做空**交易机会**。第15根K线是一个失败的**高2**，而带有**移动平均线**附近**熊市反转K线**的**低2**在熊市趋势中是一个非常高概率的做空**交易机会**，因为那些买入**高1**和**高2趋势反转尝试**的多头通常会在**低2**时退出。市场刚刚两次尝试反转当天的低点，而第二次尝试在第15根K线多头后的K线上失败了。当市场两次尝试做某事而失败时，它通常会转向相反的方向。

---

>Whenever a market begins a trend after the first hour, assume that it will lead to a trending trading range day or that it will behave like one, and look for scalps in both directions.Although there was a bull trend from the open in Figure 22.7, it ended with a spike and climax at bar 5 and then reversed down into a trending trading range bear trend. It also can be viewed as a spike and channel bear trend, with the move from bar 5 to bar 6 being the bear spike, and the moves down from bar 7 to bar 8 and then the three-bar breakout to bar 10 as additional spikes. The channel down was broad enough and the pullbacks after the two breakouts overlapped the prior swing lows so that it was also a bear stair pattern.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The market gapped down to a higher low and formed a possible bull trend from the open in Figure 22.7. It was a test of the moving average after a strong spike into the close and a failed breakout below that strong bull channel.A two-legged move up ended in a final flag short at bar 5. This was followed by a four-bar bear spike, which became part of a larger spike that ended at bar 6. This movebroke below the bull trend line of the rally from the open, so a lower high could lead to a trend reversal down.
>A two-legged lower high ended at bar 7, alerting traders to a possible continued move down.Bar 7 was a dueling lines pattern. It formed a double top with the top of the wedge bear channel down to bar 6 (the channel began with the small lower high that formed after the four-bar bear spike below bar 5), and it was a wedge bear flag (the first push up ended with the bar before bar 6, and bar 7 was the third push up).
>The market behaved like a trending trading range bear for the rest of the day. The strong bull momentum up to bar 1 and again up to bar 5 were spikes up and could be followed by a bull channel at some point over the next day or two. Bars 6, 8, and 10 created a large wedge bull flag, and a test of the bar 5 high was possible. Bar 4 can also be considered part of that bear channel. The next day (not shown) in fact gapped up near the high of bar 7 and became a strong bull trend from the open day.

##### 延迟趋势与交易策略

无论何时，如果市场在开盘一个小时后才开始形成趋势，请假定它会演变为**趋势性交易区间日**，或者表现出类似的特性，并寻找双向的**剥头皮交易机会**。虽然图22.7中显示的是一个**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势**，但它在第5根K线处以**急涨高潮**结束，随后反转向下，进入一个**趋势性交易区间熊市趋势**。它也可以被视为一个**急涨通道熊市趋势**，其中从第5根K线到第6根K线的走势是**熊市急涨**，而从第7根K线到第8根K线以及随后三根K线突破到第10根K线的走势是额外的**急涨**。下跌通道足够宽阔，而且两次**突破**后的回调都与先前的摆动低点重叠，因此它也是一个**熊市阶梯形态**。

---

##### 图表深度分析：开盘跳空与趋势反转

在图22.7中，市场**跳空低开**至更高低点，并形成了一个可能的**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势**。这是在强劲**急涨**直至收盘以及未能成功突破强劲**牛市通道**下方后对**移动平均线**的一次测试。一个**两“腿”上涨**在第5根K线处以最终旗形做空结束。随后是一个四K线**熊市急涨**，它成为一个在第6根K线处结束的更大**急涨**的一部分。这次下跌跌破了开盘上涨的**牛市趋势线**，因此一个更低的高点可能导致趋势向下反转。

---

##### 持续下跌与看跌形态

一个**两“腿”更低的高点**在第7根K线处结束，提醒交易者可能持续下跌。第7根K线是一个**对峙线形态**。它与下跌到第6根K线的**楔形熊市通道**顶部形成**双重顶**（该通道始于第5根K线下方的四K线**熊市急涨**后形成的微小更低高点），并且它是一个**楔形熊旗**（第一次上涨推动在第6根K线之前结束，第7根K线是第三次上涨推动）。

---

##### 日内走势与未来展望

市场在当天剩余时间表现得像一个**趋势性交易区间熊市**。上涨到第1根K线以及再次上涨到第5根K线的强劲牛市**动量**都是**急涨**，并可能在未来一两天内的某个时候伴随牛市通道。第6、8和10根K线形成了一个大型**楔形牛旗**，并且有可能测试第5根K线的高点。第4根K线也可以被视为该熊市通道的一部分。第二天（未显示）实际上**跳空高开**至第7根K线高点附近，并成为一个强劲的**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势日**。

>In Figure 22.8, the range for the first couple of hours was about half of an average daily range and this alerted traders to a possible breakout and the formation of a higher or lower trading range and the creation of a trending trading range day. The bull trend was already apparent before the bar 9 breakout. Notice how the bar 5 swing low was above the bar 2 low, the bar 6low was above the bar 5 low, and the bar 8 low was above the bar 6 low. The same thing was happening with the swing highs at bars 3, 4, and 7. Even though the market was in a trading range for the first two and a half hours, both the swing highs and the swing lows were trending upward, indicating that there was already a bull trend going on within the trading range. This alerted traders to watch for a breakout, which occurred at bar 9. This higher trading range lasted until the breakout that followed the reversal up at bar 13. Both bars 11and 13 were breakout tests. The double bottom at bar 11 dropped into the lower trading range, but the bar 13 low tested the bar 7 top of the lower trading range to the tick. When a pullback cannot drop below the breakout point, it is a sign of strength by the bulls.
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The market broke out below yesterday's close in Figure 22.8, and the first bar had a bear body,so the day could become a trend from the open bear trend day. However, therewere tails above and below bar 1, and this increased the chances of an initial trading range.Traders should wait. Bar 2 was a micro double bottom, but both bars were dojis so this was not a setup for a strong trend. Even the bar 4 wedge bear flag at the moving average was a weak setup because it was part of a six-bar tight trading range and all of the bars had tails.This means that there is uncertainty, and that is the hallmark of a trading range. Traders could have bought above the bull inside bar that followed bar 5, but after that bar 4 wedge bear flag the market should have a second test down. This occurred at bar 6 and formed a double bottom with bar 5 and a double bottom pullback for the double bottom at the low of the day (bar 2 and the bar three bars later). It would be safer to wait to buy until after more evidence of bull strength, like the four-bar bull spike up to bar 7, but there were a couple of strong bull trend bars just after bar 2, and this is a good enough sign of strength to start taking long trades on pullbacks. Those large bull trend bars are a sign of buying pressure, which is cumulative. Once there is a critical mass of buying, the bulls take control and the market goes up.
>After that bull spike to bar 7, there was a breakout pullback buy setup above the bull inside bar that followed bar 8, and that was also a failed low 2 buy signal. There was a high 2 long setup four bars later that led to the bar 9 strong bull breakout.

##### 初始区间中的趋势迹象与突破

如图22.8所示，前几个小时的波动范围大约是平均日波动范围的一半，这提醒交易者注意可能出现的**突破**，并形成更高或更低的**交易区间**，从而创造一个**趋势性交易区间日**。在第9根K线**突破**之前，牛市趋势就已经很明显了。请注意，第5根K线的摆动低点高于第2根K线的低点，第6根K线的低点高于第5根K线的低点，而第8根K线的低点高于第6根K线的低点。同样的情况也发生在第3、4和7根K线的摆动高点上。尽管市场在前两个半小时处于**交易区间**内，但摆动高点和摆动低点都在向上发展，表明**交易区间**内部已经存在牛市趋势。这提醒交易者关注**突破**，**突破**发生在第9根K线。这个更高的**交易区间**一直持续到第13根K线向上反转后的**突破**。第11和13根K线都是**突破测试**。第11根K线处的**双重底**跌入较低的**交易区间**，但第13根K线的低点**精确地**测试了第7根K线（较低**交易区间**的顶部）。当回调未能跌破**突破点**时，这是多头强势的迹象。

##### 盘面深度分析：开盘特征与早期交易机会

在图22.8中，市场跌破昨天收盘价开盘，第一根K线是**熊市实体K线**，因此当天可能成为一个**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势日**。然而，第1根K线上下都有影线，这增加了形成初始**交易区间**的可能性。交易者应该等待。第2根K线是一个**微型双重底**，但两根K线都是**十字星**，所以这不是一个强劲趋势的**交易机会**。甚至第4根K线处的**楔形熊旗**（位于**移动平均线**附近）也是一个弱势“交易机会”，因为它是一个六K线紧密**交易区间**的一部分，并且所有K线都带有影线。这意味着存在**不确定性**，而这正是**交易区间**的标志。交易者可以在第5根K线之后的**牛市内包K线**上方买入，但在第4根K线**楔形熊旗**之后，市场应该进行第二次向下测试。这发生在第6根K线，并与第5根K线形成**双重底**，同时也是当天低点（第2根K线和之后三根K线）**双重底**的**双重底回调**。更安全的做法是等待更多牛市强势的证据（例如上涨到第7根K线的四K线**牛市急涨**）后再买入，但在第2根K线之后出现了几根强劲的**牛市趋势K线**，这足以成为在回调时进行做多交易的强势迹象。这些大型**牛市趋势K线**是买盘压力的迹象，买盘压力是累积的。一旦买盘达到临界量，多头就会掌握控制权，市场就会上涨。

---

##### 突破前后的买入机会

在上涨到第7根K线的**牛市急涨**之后，在第8根K线之后的**牛市内包K线**上方有一个**突破回调**买入**交易机会**，这也是一个失败的**低2**买入信号。四根K线之后有一个**高2做多**“交易机会”，这导致了第9根K线的强劲**牛市突破**。

>Just because the range of the first couple of hours is about half that of an average day does not mean there will be a breakout into a trending trading range day. In about a third of cases,the range increases by a breakout of both the high and low of the day, as it did in Figure 22.9.The market reversed up from new lows of the day at bars 4 and 6, and down from new highs of the day at bars 3, 10,12,19, and 21. The opening range probably ended with the reversal down from bar 5, and at that point the range of the day was about half that of recent days. This alerted traders to the possibility of a breakout either up or down and then a measured move that would approximately double the day's range. However, simply entering on the breakout of a trading range is a losing strategy since the market always has inertia and most attempts to change from a trading range to a trend, or from a trend to a trading range, fail. No good short developed after the bar 6 breakout to a new low of the day, and in fact the bar 7 higher low after the three pushes down (bars 2, 4, and 6) and the bar 8 breakout pullback were reasonable buy signals for a test of the high of the day.
>Bar 10 reversed down after breaking to a new high of the day, but the market was in a tight bull channel and therefore this was not a good short setup. The momentum up was not particularly strong so buying the bar 11 breakout pullback was a scalp trade at best. The market turned down again with a two-bar reversal at bar 12. Second-entry reversals on trading range days are usually reliable for at least a scalp.
>The market had a run to a new high of the day after the bar 16 wedge bull flag and the market again failed at bars 19 and 21. Once it was clear that the upside breakout would not succeed,the market once again tried for a breakout of the opposite end of the day. As is often the case on trading range days, the market closed in the middle of the range.
>When there are several possibilities for the top and bottom of the opening range, it usually does not matter which you choose because there is no agreement. When looking for a measured move target where you can take profits, initially use the smallest possibility for the opening range, like bar 2 to bar 3. If the market does not pause in that area, then look at the next larger possibility, like bar 3 to bar 4, or bar 3 to bar 6. Since today ended as a trading range day and not a trending trading range day, the obvious measured move targets were not reached. However, every reversal is due to computer algorithms based on some measurement, and there is almost always some type of measured move in the equation, even if it is not obvious.

##### 开盘区间与双向突破的可能性

即使开盘前几个小时的波动范围大约是平均日波动范围的一半，这也不意味着一定会演变成**趋势性交易区间日**。在大约三分之一的情况下，日波动范围会通过高点和低点的双向**突破**而扩大，如图22.9所示。市场从第4和第6根K线的日内新低向上反转，并从第3、10、12、19和21根K线的日内新高向下反转。**开盘区间**可能在第5根K线向下反转后结束，此时日波动范围大约是近期日波动范围的一半。这提醒交易者注意向上或向下**突破**的可能性，随后可能会出现大致使日波动范围翻倍的**量度移动**。然而，仅仅在**交易区间**的**突破**处入场是一种亏损策略，因为市场总是具有**惯性**，并且大多数从**交易区间**转向趋势或从趋势转向**交易区间**的尝试都会失败。在第6根K线**突破**日内新低后，没有出现好的做空**交易机会**，事实上，在三次下跌推动（第2、4和6根K线）后的第7根K线更高低点以及第8根K线**突破回调**都是合理的买入信号，目标是测试日内高点。

---

##### 紧密通道中的反转与剥头皮交易

第10根K线在突破日内新高后向下反转，但市场处于一个紧密的**牛市通道**中，因此这不是一个好的做空**交易机会**。上涨动量不特别强劲，因此买入第11根K线**突破回调**充其量只是一次**剥头皮交易**。市场在第12根K线处以两K线反转再次下跌。**交易区间日**的**二次入场反转**通常至少对于**剥头皮交易**来说是可靠的。

---

##### 尾盘尝试与收盘特征

在第16根K线**楔形牛旗**之后，市场再次上涨到日内新高，但市场在第19和21根K线处再次失败。一旦明确向上**突破**不会成功，市场再次尝试**突破**当日的另一端。正如**交易区间日**经常出现的情况一样，市场收盘在波动范围的中部。

---

##### 量度移动目标的判断

当**开盘区间**的顶部和底部有几种可能性时，通常选择哪一个并不重要，因为没有统一的共识。在寻找可以获利了结的**量度移动目标**时，最初可以使用**开盘区间**的最小可能性，例如第2根K线到第3根K线。如果市场在该区域没有暂停，那么就查看下一个更大的可能性，例如第3根K线到第4根K线，或者第3根K线到第6根K线。由于今天最终是一个**交易区间日**，而不是一个**趋势性交易区间日**，所以明显的**量度移动目标**没有达到。然而，每一次反转都是由于基于某种测量的计算机算法造成的，并且方程式中几乎总是包含某种类型的**量度移动**，即使它不明显。

---

>Sometimes the initial trading range is about half of the size of an average daily range and the breakout does not come until the final hour. In Figure 22.10, although there was not enough time left to form much of an upper range, the day was a setup for a breakout into a trending trading range day all day long. The range prior to the breakout was only 5.25 points and there were only two days in the past 11 months that ended with a range of 5.25 points or less. This meant that other days this year that may have had a 5.25 range for most of the day had a bigger range by the close, and that made it likely for today to have a late breakout up or down as well. Since the market had been trending up since the bar 7 triple bottom and triangle, and the number of bars between bars 9 and 12 with bull bodies was high, buying pressure was present and an upside breakout was likely. Traders would have bought on the bar 14 breakout above the bar 4 high of the day and on the close of the strong bar 14 breakout bar and again above its high.
>The initial bear spike from bar 3 to bar 4 generated a measured move to the high of the day.Traders never know which of the possible measured move targets will be the level where the bulls will take profits, but it is good to be aware of the possibilities so you, too, can take profits as the market is racing up rather than a couple of points lower on the sell-off. The market might have also topped out at a measured move based on the bar 1 low to the bar 2 high or from the bar 5 low to the bar 4, 6, 10, or 12 high.

##### **尾盘突破：全天布局的趋势性交易机会**

有时，初始**交易区间**大约是平均日波动范围的一半，而**突破**直到最后一小时才出现。在图22.10中，尽管没有足够的时间形成一个较大的上方区间，但当天全天都是**突破**进入**趋势性交易区间日**的**交易机会**。**突破**之前的波动范围只有5.25点，而在过去11个月中，只有两天以5.25点或更小的范围收盘。这意味着今年其他大部分时间波动范围为5.25点的日子，在收盘时范围都有所扩大，这使得今天也很可能出现一个尾盘的向上或向下**突破**。由于市场自第7根K线**三重底**和**三角形**以来一直向上运行趋势，并且第9和12根K线之间带有牛市实体的K线数量很多，买盘压力存在，因此向上**突破**的可能性很高。交易者会在第14根K线**突破**第4根K线当天高点时买入，并在强劲的第14根K线**突破K线**收盘时再次买入，并在其高点上方再次买入。

---

##### **量度移动：获利了结的考量**

从第3根K线到第4根K线的初始**熊市急涨**产生了向日内高点的**量度移动**。交易者永远不知道哪个可能的**量度移动目标**会是多头获利了结的水平，但了解这些可能性是好的，这样您也可以在市场快速上涨时获利了结，而不是在回调时低两点才平仓。市场也可能在基于第1根K线低点到第2根K线高点，或者从第5根K线低点到第4、6、10或12根K线高点的**量度移动**处见顶。
