>Primary characteristics of trend from the open days:
>
>• The low of a bull trend day or the high of a bear trend day is formed within the first few bars of the day.
>• If the opening range of the day is less than 25 percent of the average daily range of recent days, there may be a double bottom on a bull trend day or a double top on a bear trend day (if the opening range is about 50 percent of the average daily range, a breakout is more likely to lead to a trending trading range day).
>• The day may begin with a strong spike lasting many bars or it may have a small opening range.
>• If the market trends from the first bar or so and the initial spike lasts three or more bars,entering on the first pullback is usually good for at least a scalp.• If there is a strong spike on the open that lasts many bars and covers many points, the day will usually become a spike and channel trend day.
>• A large gap opening often leads to a trend from the open day, and the trend can go in either direction. When there is a large gap up and a trend from the open day forms, the day will be a bull trend day about 60 percent of the time and a bear trend day 40 percent of the time. The opposite is true for gap down openings. The larger the gap, the more likely the day will be a trend day and the more likely the trend will be in the direction of the gap.
>• Trend from the open days have urgency and conviction from the outset and are usually the strongest trends and have the smallest pullbacks.
>• Twenty gap bar and moving average gap bar setups come late in the trend.
>• The strongest type of a trend from the open day and the strongest type of trend is one where the opening range is small, and then the day trends relentlessly with small pullbacks all day long. This is a small pullback trend day. For example, the pullbacks in the Emini might be just 10 to 12 ticks (10 to 30 percent of the average daily range). When that is the case, there is usually a pullback in the final couple of hours that is about 150 to 200 percent of the size of the earlier pullbacks, followed by a resumption of the trend into the close.
>• To an experienced trader, the swing setups are 70 percent or more likely to work, even though to they never look that certain to a beginner. Many of the signal bars look bad, as is the case for all strong trends. Most setups appear to have 50 percent or less probability of success.This makes traders not take the trades and forces them to chase the market, or miss the trend completely.
>• There are often many trend bars in the opposite direction, which is a sign of countertrend pressure, and it keeps beginning traders looking for reversals instead of with-trend trades. For example, in a bull trend, there will be many bear trend bars and many two-bar and three-bar bear spikes. Beginners repeatedly short them and lose. The spikes evolve into bull flags that look weak, which discourages beginners from buying them. They just got out of a losing short and are not ready emotionally to risk losing again, especially on a setup that does not look strong. Each bad-looking bull flag is successful, and is followed by another good-looking short setup that fails.
>• The trend is often in a relatively tight channel, and pullbacks often come back and hit breakeven stops, trapping traders out. Traders need to trail their stops below swing lows in a bull trend or above swing highs in a bear trend. If they are too eager to move their stops to breakeven, they will get trapped out.

##### **开盘即趋势日**的主要特征：

- **日内极值形成时间**：牛市**开盘即趋势日**的最低点或熊市**开盘即趋势日**的最高点，在交易日的前几根K线内形成。
    
- **开盘区间与形态**：如果日开盘区间小于近期日平均波动范围的25%，则牛市**开盘即趋势日**可能会出现**双重底**，或熊市**开盘即趋势日**会出现**双重顶**（如果开盘区间约为平均日波动范围的50%，则**突破**更有可能导致**趋势性交易区间日**）。
    
- **起始急涨或小开盘区间**：当天可能以持续多根K线的强劲**急涨**开始，或者开盘区间很小。
    
- **首次回调入场**：如果市场从第一根K线左右开始趋势运行，并且初始**急涨**持续三根或更多K线，那么在第一次回调时入场通常至少可以获得**剥头皮**利润。
    
- **强劲开盘急涨的后续**：如果开盘时有一个强劲的**急涨**，持续多根K线并覆盖大量点位，那么当天通常会成为**急涨通道趋势日**。
    
- **大型跳空与趋势方向**：大型**跳空开盘**通常会导致**开盘即趋势日**，并且趋势可以向任一方向发展。当出现大型**跳空高开**并形成**开盘即趋势日**时，大约60%的时间会是牛市趋势日，40%的时间会是熊市趋势日。**跳空低开**的情况则相反。跳空越大，当天成为趋势日的可能性越大，并且趋势方向越可能与跳空方向一致。
    
- **强劲趋势的特征**：**开盘即趋势日**从一开始就具有紧迫感和信念，通常是**最强劲的趋势**，并且**回调最小**。
    
- **特定交易机会的出现时机**：20**缺口K线**和**移动平均线缺口K线**的“交易机会”在趋势后期出现。
    
- **最强劲的开盘即趋势日类型**：最强劲的**开盘即趋势日**类型和最强劲的趋势是开盘区间很小，然后全天无情地趋势运行，伴随着小幅回调。这是一种**小幅回调趋势日（small pullback trend day）**。例如，Emini的回调可能只有10到12个跳动点（平均日波动范围的10%到30%）。在这种情况下，通常在最后几个小时会有一个回调，其幅度约为之前回调的150%到200%，随后趋势恢复直到收盘。
    
- **熟练交易者的胜率**：对于经验丰富的交易者来说，**波段交易机会**的成功率在70%或更高，尽管对于初学者来说它们从不显得那么确定。许多信号K线看起来很差，所有强劲趋势都是如此。大多数“交易机会”的成功概率看起来只有50%或更低。这使得交易者不进行交易，迫使他们追涨杀跌，或者完全错过趋势。
    
- **反趋势压力与初学者误区**：趋势中经常出现许多反方向的趋势K线，这是反趋势压力的迹象，它使初学者持续寻找反转，而不是顺势交易。例如，在牛市趋势中，会有许多看跌趋势K线，以及许多两K线和三K线看跌**急涨**。初学者反复做空它们并亏损。这些**急涨**演变为看起来很弱的**牛旗**，这阻碍了初学者买入它们。他们刚刚从亏损的空头头寸中出场，情绪上还没有准备好再次冒险亏损，特别是在一个看起来不强的“交易机会”上。每一个看起来很差的**牛旗**都成功了，随后是另一个看起来不错的做空**交易机会**却失败了。
    
- **紧密通道与止损设置**：趋势通常处于一个相对紧密的通道中，回调经常会回撤并触发盈亏平衡止损，将交易者**诱出**。交易者需要将止损跟踪在牛市趋势的摆动低点下方，或熊市趋势的摆动高点上方。如果他们过于急于将止损移至盈亏平衡点，他们就会被**诱出**。

>Since almost all small pullback days are trend from the open days, they should be considered to be a strong variant. A trend from the open day is usually the strongest form of trend pattern, but it develops in only about 20 percent of days. That means that buying above the first bar or shorting below it, expecting it to be the start of a strong trend, is a low-probability trade. Reversals are far more common in the first hour, as is discussed in book 3. The chance of the first bar being the high or low of the day on a day when there is a large gap opening can be 50 percent or more, if the bar is a strong trend bar in either direction. The high or low of the day forms within the first five bars or so in about 50 percent of days. However, it forms within the opening range, which can last a couple of hours, in about 90 percent of days. Any type of trend day can trend from the open. In a trend from the open day, the market forms one extreme in the first bar or first few bars and then trends all day, and often closes  at or near the opposite extreme. There may be a small trading range for the first 30 minutes or so and then a breakout, but the open of the day will usually be very close to one extreme of the day (the low in a bull trend or the high in a bear trend). These days often open with large gaps and then the market continues as a trend in either direction. In other words, a large gap down can lead to either a bull or a bear trend from the open day. The setup is more reliable if it forms at a strong magnet like a trend channel line (for example, forming a wedge reversal setup) or if it is part of a reversal pattern, like a reversal from a final flag at yesterday's close.
>This type of trend can be so strong that there can be follow-through in the first hour or two of the next day, so traders should be looking to enter with trend on pullbacks after the open of the next day. The pullback often is strong enough to make traders wonder if the market is reversing, but it is usually just a higher time frame, two-legged correction, like a pullback to the 15 minute moving average. However, most traders would find it easier to simply read only one chart when trading and there is always a 5 minute setup at the end of the pullback.
>As a trend from the open day is evolving, the pullbacks are often very small all day long. When this happens, this is a small pullback trend day. This is the strongest type of trend day and it forms only once or twice a month. About two-thirds of these days have a larger pullback after 11:00 a.m. PST. That pullback is often about twice the size of the biggest pullback since the trend began in the first hour. It is often heralded by a relatively large, strong trend bar or two in the direction of the trend, but representing climactic exhaustion. Take the example of a small pullback bull trend day when the biggest pullback has been nine ticks and the market has been channeling up all day. If sometime between 11:00 a.m. PST and noon the market has two relatively large consecutive bull trend bars breaking out to a new high, the move is more likely an exhaustive buy climax than the start of a new leg. Climaxes are discussed more in the third book, but when a trend has gone on for a long time and then has unusual further strength, it usually signals the end of the move for the time being and the start of a two-legged pullback that will last about 10 bars or so. Experienced traders are expecting a three- to five-point pullback and they will exit their longs. Some will even short the close of that second bull trend bar, or maybe a tick or two above its high, expecting the pullback. They might wait for the next bar to close, and if it has a close around the middle, they might short the close. If it is a bear reversal bar, they might short below its low. If they entered below a bear reversal bar, their protective stop would be above its high, but if they entered at the market at the close of the bull spike, they might use a three- or four-point stop and scale in a point or two higher. Even if they are wrong and the market does not sell off for a few points, it will likely enter a trading range and they should be able to get out with a small profit within the final hour.
>There might have been a slightly larger pullback in the first hour just before the trend began,but only the pullbacks after the trend began are important. Look at their size and if they are all very small and each subsequent one stays around the same size or smaller than the first, the day is a strong trend day. For example, in a bull trend in the Emini where the average daily range has been about 12 points, the pullbacks might all be just two or three points. The bulls want a bigger pullback where they can get long, hoping for less risk. After waiting and not getting what they want, they start taking small positions at the market and on small pullbacks. This small buying all day long keeps lifting the market. The bears never see a great short and they decide instead to short smaller positions and weaker setups. There is no follow-through and they are forced to cover, and this buying adds to the slow rise in the market. Momentum traders see the trend and they, too, buy all day long. The trend usually continues all day with only small pullbacks, but because the bulls have been buying small positions all day long, they never have to chase the market up in a panic. Also, because the bears are never heavily short, there is not strong short covering. The result is that even though the day is a trend day, it often does not cover too many points and the bulls do not make a windfall profit, even though they were on the right side of a strong trend.
>A report at 7:00 a.m. PST can often lead to a reversal bar, a breakout bar, or a large outside bar that becomes the start of a strong trend, which can last all day. However, computers have a huge edge on reports. They receive the data instantly in a format that they can process to make decisions that lead to orders. All of this happens within a second, and it gives them a significant advantage over traders. When the computers have a big edge, traders are at a disadvantage and therefore should rarely enter at the moment a report is released. The computers will usually show what the always-in trade is within a bar or two, or they will set up a strong reversal. Traders will then have probability on their side, and can look to enter in the appropriate direction. The strong bar that leads to the start of the trend does not always come on a report and can form several bars before or after the report. It happens on the report often enough for traders to be ready for it and then to enter as soon as the always-in position becomes clear.
>Sometimes, after about 30 minutes of a small range, there is a test of the open that occurs around 7:00 a.m. PST, usually coinciding with a report. Although this results in a small trading range, the trend that breaks out is much stronger than that seen on a trending trading range day; it is identical to a trend from the open day and should be considered a variant.
>Even the best patterns still fail to do what you expect about 40 percent of the time. If the market does not pause by the third or fourth bar, it might have gone too far too fast, and this increases the chances that the market will reverse instead of trend.
>Every day begins as a trend from the open day within the first few bars of the day. As soon as a bar moves above the high of the prior bar, the day is a trend from the open bull trend day, at least for that moment. If instead it trades below the low of the first bar, it is a trend from the open bear trend day. On most days, the move does not have much follow-through and there is a reversal, and the day evolves into some other type of day. However, when the breakout of the prior bar grows into a larger spike, the odds of a strong trend from the open trend day increase considerably, and traders should begin to trade the day as a strong trend day.
>If the market trends for four or more bars without a pullback, or even two large trend bars, the move should be considered to be a strong spike. The spike is an area where both bulls and bears agree that very little trading should take place, and the market therefore needs to quickly move to another price level. When the spike begins during the first few bars, the day is a trend from the open day. It may remain so for the rest of the day, but sometimes the market soon reverses and breaks out in the other direction. This can result in a trend in the opposite direction, like a spike and channel trend or a trending trading range day, or simply a trading range day. As with any strong spike, the bulls who bought early on will take partial profits at some point, creating a small pullback (as discussed earlier in the section on trends). Other bulls who missed the move will aggressively buy the pullback, as will bulls who want a larger position. The bulls will buy with limit orders at and below the low of the prior bar, hoping that the current bar will fall below the prior bar and allow them to buy a little lower. Other bulls will buy with stop orders above the high of the pullback bar (a high 1 buy signal).
>A spike is usually followed by one of three things. First, the market might have gone too far too fast and be experiencing exhaustive climactic behavior. For example, if there is then a pause or pullback like an inside bar or a small wedge flag, this could become a final flag and lead to a reversal after a small breakout, and the reversal could last for several hours. Alternatively,the market might go sideways in a tight trading range for several hours, followed by the trend resuming into the close, resulting in a trend resumption day. This small, sideways movement is very common following a relentless five- to 10-bar spike. The third and most common outcome, when the spike is not so large as to be exhaustive, is the formation of a trend channel, and the day then becomes a spike and channel trend day.
>Entering on the first pullback after a strong first leg is simply capitalizing on the propensity for strong moves to test the extreme. Most strong moves have at least two legs, so entering on the first pullback has a very good chance of leading to a profitable trade. This entry is especially important on trend from the open days if you missed the original entry. In strong trends, what constitutes the first pullback is not always clear because trends frequently have two or three sideways bars that don't break a meaningful trend line and therefore really aren't significant enough to constitute a pull "back." However, even if there is no retracement and no real pulling back in price, a pause is a sideways correction and is a variant of a pullback.
>The single most difficult part of trading these very strong trend days is that the trends do not look particularly strong as they are forming. There are usually no impressive spikes or easy,high-probability pullbacks to the moving average. Instead, the market has pullbacks after every few bars and lots of trend bars in the opposite direction. It often is in a weak-looking channel. What beginners fail to see is that the pullbacks are all small, the market never seems to get back to the moving average, and the price keeps moving slowly away from the open.Experienced traders see all of these things as signs that the bull trend is very strong, and this gives them the confidence to take swing trades. They correctly know that, although the bars look like they are part of a weak channel and therefore should create low-probability setups,when they occur in a small pullback bull trend day, they form high-probability swing setups.All pullbacks in trend from the open days are great with trend entries, even though they almost always look weak. A trader can continue to have confidence entering with trend even after a pullback finally breaks a meaningful trend line. In a strong bull trend, look to buy at the low of the prior bar, or one or two ticks below its low, or on a stop at one tick above high 1 and high 2 setups. Look at the size of the pullbacks since the trend began. For example, in a small pullback bull trend, if the largest pullback in the past couple of hours has been only eight ticks, buy with a limit order at five to seven ticks below the high of the day. In strong bear trends, traders will do the opposite and short at the high of the prior bar or one or two ticks above it, on a stop at one tick below low 1 and low 2 signal bars, and on any bounce that is about the size of an average bar.
>The market has inertia and the first attempt to end the trend usually fails. Once a trend line has been broken and there has been a significant pullback, then the first leg of the trend has likely ended. Even then, the first break of the trend line has high odds of setting up a with-trend entry that will lead to a second trend leg and a new extreme in the trend.
>The pullbacks often have weak signal bars, and there are many countertrend trend bars. For example, in a strong bull trend, most of the buy signal bars might be small bear trend bars or doji bars, and several of the entry bars might be outside up bars with small bodies. They often follow two or three consecutive bear trend bars or bear micro channels. This constant selling pressure makes many traders look for sell signals, trapping them out of the bull trend. The sell signals never look quite strong enough, but the traders sell anyway because they look better than the buy signals, and they want to trade. They see that there was a pullback after just about every buy signal that comes back and hits a breakeven stop and think that this is a sign of a weak bull trend. They see that it is a bull trend and want to get long, but can't figure out how to do so, because they think every buy signal looks bad. The pullbacks are too small and the setups are too weak. Also, since these days happen only a couple of times a month, they are conditioned to the other days, when selling pressure usually leads to a tradable short, so they continue to short sell setups that don't quite look right. They don't look right because they are the start of bull flags, not reversals. However, when experienced traders see a bull trend with small pullbacks and an inability to fall below the moving average, along with many bear trend bars and weak buy signals, they understand what is going on. They see traders being trapped out of longs and being fooled into constantly looking for tops, and know that this bull trend is especially strong. The experienced trader knows that too many traders will be doing the opposite of what they should be doing, and will be forced to exit their losing shorts and chase the market up. This creates a relentless tension on the upside where many traders want to buy but don't, and experienced traders buy relentlessly and have a very profitable day.
>These days are usually in relatively tight channels, and if traders are looking to swing their trades, they should not be overly eager to move their stops to breakeven. When a trend is in a tight channel, it will usually come back to the entry price before reaching a new trend extreme, and inexperienced, fearful traders will mistakenly let themselves get trapped out of a strong trend. For example, if there is a strong bull trend, the market will often come back to the entry price at the signal bar high in five to 10 bars, and will often dip a tick or two below it.This can make beginning traders nervous. They had enough profit for a scalp, but since the day was a trend day, they wanted to swing the trade for a larger profit. Now, after an hour, the market is back to the entry price. They worried for an hour because the market was not going much above the entry price, and they are now afraid that their winner will turn into a loser.They cannot take the pain anymore and exit with a small profit or loss. A few bars later, they are upset because the market is now at a new high and they are on the sidelines, trapped out of a great trade, waiting to buy the next pullback. They should trail their protective stops below the most recent swing low only after the market pulls back to the area of the signal bar high and then rallies to a new high. Trends tend to have trending highs and lows, so once a bull trend makes a new high, traders will raise their protective stops to just below the most recent swing low. Since they expect trending lows, they want the next pullback to stay above the last. If the market begins to enter a trading range, pullbacks will fall below prior higher lows, and they will then adjust to a trading range style of trading (discussed in book 2).
>If there is a gap open that is more than just a few ticks and the first bar is a strong trend bar (small tail, good-sized bar), trading its breakout in either direction is usually a good trade. The first bar of every day is a signal bar for a trend from the open bull day and a trend from the open bear day, depending on the direction of the breakout of the bar. If you enter and your protective stop is hit on the next bar, consider reversing for a swing trade because the market will usually move more than the number of ticks that you lost on the first entry, and there is always the possibility that it could develop into a trend from the open day.
>Even if there is not a gap open, a trend bar for the first bar is a good setup for a trade; but the chance for success is higher if there is a gap, since the market is more overdone and any move will tend to be stronger.

##### 小幅回调日的强劲性与开盘即趋势日的特点

由于几乎所有**小幅回调日**都是**开盘即趋势日**，它们应被视为一种强劲的变体。**开盘即趋势日**通常是趋势模式中最强劲的形式，但它只在大约20%的日子里出现。这意味着在第一根K线上方买入或下方做空，期望它是强劲趋势的开始，是一种低概率的**交易机会**。如第三本书所讨论的，在开盘跳空较大的日子里，第一根K线成为当天高点或低点的可能性可达50%甚至更高，如果这根K线是向任一方向的强劲趋势K线。在大约50%的日子里，当天的高点或低点在最初的五根K线左右形成。然而，在大约90%的日子里，它形成在**开盘区间**内，**开盘区间**可以持续几个小时。任何类型的趋势日都可以从开盘开始趋势。在**开盘即趋势日**中，市场在第一根K线或最初几根K线中形成一个极端，然后全天运行趋势，并且通常在或接近相反的极端收盘。最初的30分钟左右可能会有一个**小交易区间**，然后出现**突破**，但当天的开盘价通常会非常接近当天的一个极端（牛市趋势中的低点或熊市趋势中的高点）。这些日子通常以大**跳空**开盘，然后市场以任一方向继续运行趋势。换句话说，大**跳空低开**可能导致**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势日**或**熊市趋势日**。如果**交易机会**在强劲的磁体（如趋势通道线，例如形成**楔形反转交易机会**）处形成，或者它是反转模式的一部分（如从昨天收盘时的**最终旗形**反转），那么它会更可靠。

---

##### 趋势延续与回调入场

这类趋势可能非常强劲，以至于在第二天开盘后的**一两个小时**内仍有**跟进动量**，因此交易者应在第二天开盘后寻找在回调时**顺势入场**。回调通常足够强劲，以至于让交易者怀疑市场是否正在反转，但它通常只是更高时间框架上的**两“腿”修正**，例如回调到15分钟**移动平均线**。然而，大多数交易者会发现，在交易时只阅读一张图表会更容易，并且在回调结束时总会有一个5分钟**交易机会**。

---

##### 小幅回调趋势日的特点与交易策略

当**开盘即趋势日**演变时，回调通常全天都非常小。当这种情况发生时，这就是**小幅回调趋势日**。这是最强劲的趋势日类型，每月只出现一两次。大约三分之二的这类日子在太平洋时间上午11:00之后会有一次较大的回调。这次回调通常是趋势在第一小时开始以来最大回调的两倍左右。它通常伴随着一到两根相对较大、强劲的**顺势趋势K线**，但这代表着**竭尽高潮**。以一个**小幅回调牛市趋势日**为例，如果最大回调是九个跳动点，并且市场全天都在向上通道运行。如果在太平洋时间上午11:00到中午之间，市场有两根相对较大且连续的**牛市趋势K线**突破新高，那么这次上涨更可能是一个**竭尽的买入高潮**，而不是新一“腿”的开始。**高潮**在第三本书中有更多讨论，但当一个趋势持续了很长时间，然后出现异常的进一步强势时，它通常预示着当前走势的结束，以及一个持续约10根K线左右的**两“腿”回调**的开始。经验丰富的交易者预期会有三到五点的回调，他们会退出多头头寸。有些人甚至会在第二根牛市趋势K线收盘时做空，或者在其高点上方一两个跳动点做空，预期会有回调。他们可能会等待下一根K线收盘，如果它收盘在中间位置，他们可能会在收盘时做空。如果它是一个**熊市反转K线**，他们可能会在其低点下方做空。如果他们在**熊市反转K线**下方入场，他们的**保护性止损**将设在其高点上方，但如果他们在牛市**急涨**收盘时市价入场，他们可能会使用三到四点的止损，并向上**分批加仓**一两个点。即使他们错了，市场没有下跌几点，它也可能会进入一个**交易区间**，他们应该能够在最后一小时内以小幅利润退出。

---

##### 回调大小与趋势强度

在趋势开始之前，第一个小时可能有一个稍微大一点的回调，但只有趋势开始后的回调才重要。观察它们的大小，如果它们都非常小，并且每个随后的回调都保持与第一个回调相同的大小或更小，那么当天就是一个强劲的趋势日。例如，在Emini的牛市趋势中，如果平均日波动范围约为12点，那么回调可能都只有两三点。多头希望有更大的回调，以便他们能够以更小的风险做多。在等待而未得到他们想要的回调后，他们开始在市场和小幅回调时建立小头寸。这种全天持续的小幅买入使市场不断上涨。空头从未看到很好的做空**交易机会**，他们转而决定做空较小的头寸和较弱的**交易机会**。没有**跟进动量**，他们被迫平仓，而这种买入增加了市场的缓慢上涨。动量交易者看到趋势，他们也全天都在买入。趋势通常全天持续，只有**小幅回调**，但由于多头全天都在买入小头寸，他们从不必恐慌地追涨。此外，由于空头从未大量做空，也没有强劲的空头回补。结果是，尽管当天是一个趋势日，但它通常不会上涨太多点，多头也没有获得意外之财，尽管他们处于强劲趋势的正确一方。

---

##### 报告对趋势启动的影响

太平洋时间上午7:00的报告通常可能导致**反转K线**、**突破K线**或大型**外包K线**，从而开启一个可能持续全天的强劲趋势。然而，计算机在报告方面具有巨大优势。它们即时接收数据，并以可处理的格式进行决策，从而生成订单。所有这一切都在一秒钟内发生，这使它们相对于交易者具有显著优势。当计算机具有巨大优势时，交易者处于劣势，因此很少应该在报告发布时入场。计算机通常会在一两根K线内显示出“总是处于”的交易方向，或者它们会设置一个强劲的反转。交易者此时将拥有概率优势，可以寻找在适当方向入场。导致趋势开始的强劲K线不一定总是在报告发布时出现，它可能在报告之前或之后几根K线形成。它在报告发布时出现的频率足以让交易者做好准备，并在“总是处于”的仓位明确后立即入场。

---

##### 小范围开盘后的趋势变体

有时，在约30分钟的小范围波动之后，在太平洋时间上午7:00左右会出现对开盘价的测试，通常与报告发布同时发生。尽管这会形成一个**小交易区间**，但随后**突破**的趋势比**趋势性交易区间日**上看到的趋势要强劲得多；它与**开盘即趋势日**完全相同，应被视为其一个变体。

---

##### 模式失败与过快上涨的风险

即使是最好的模式，大约40%的时间也无法达到您的预期。如果市场在第三或第四根K线之前没有暂停，它可能上涨过快，这增加了市场反转而不是继续趋势的可能性。

---

##### 每日开盘即趋势的动态演变

每天都在最初几根K线内以**开盘即趋势日**的形式开始。一旦一根K线突破前一根K线的高点，当天就是**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势日**，至少在那一刻是如此。如果它跌破第一根K线的低点，它就是**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势日**。在大多数日子里，这种走势没有太多的**跟进动量**，并且会出现反转，然后当天演变为其他类型的日子。然而，当对前一根K线的**突破**演变为更大的**急涨**时，**开盘即趋势日**出现强劲趋势的几率会大大增加，交易者应该开始将当天视为一个强劲的趋势日进行交易。

##### 强劲急涨的后续走势

如果市场连续四根或更多K线没有回调，甚至出现两根大型趋势K线，那么这次走势应被视为一次强劲的**急涨**。**急涨**是一个多头和空头都认为不应进行太多交易的区域，因此市场需要迅速移动到另一个价格水平。当**急涨**在最初几根K线内开始时，当天就是**开盘即趋势日**。它可能会在当天剩余时间保持这种状态，但有时市场很快会反转并向另一个方向**突破**。这可能导致相反方向的趋势，例如**急涨通道趋势**或**趋势性交易区间日**，或者仅仅是一个**交易区间日**。与任何强劲**急涨**一样，早期买入的多头会在某个时候部分获利了结，从而造成一次**小幅回调**（如前面趋势部分所讨论的）。其他错过走势的多头以及想要更大仓位的多头会积极买入回调。多头会以**限价单**在当前K线低点及以下买入，希望当前K线能跌破前一根K线，让他们可以以更低的价格买入。其他多头会以**止损单**在回调K线高点上方买入（一个**高1买入信号**）。

---

##### 急涨后的三种可能情况

**急涨**之后通常会发生以下三种情况之一。首先，市场可能上涨过快，正在经历**竭尽高潮行为**。例如，如果随后出现暂停或回调，例如**内包K线**或**小型楔形旗形**，这可能成为一个**最终旗形**，并在小幅**突破**后导致反转，反转可能会持续几个小时。或者，市场可能会在紧密的**交易区间**内横盘整理几个小时，随后趋势在收盘前恢复，导致**趋势恢复日**。这种小幅横向移动在五到十K线无情**急涨**之后非常常见。第三种也是最常见的结果，当**急涨**没有大到**竭尽**时，是形成**趋势通道**，然后当天成为**急涨通道趋势日**。

---

##### 首次回调入场的优势

在强劲的第一“腿”之后，在第一次回调时入场只是利用了强劲走势倾向于测试极端的特性。大多数强劲走势至少有**两“腿”**，因此在第一次回调时入场很有可能带来盈利交易。这种入场在**开盘即趋势日**中尤其重要，如果您错过了最初的入场。在强劲趋势中，构成第一次回调的内容并不总是清晰的，因为趋势经常有两到三根横向K线，它们没有突破有意义的趋势线，因此实际上不足以构成一次真正的“回调”。然而，即使没有回撤，也没有真正的价格回调，暂停也是一种横向修正，是回调的一种变体。

---

##### 强劲趋势日交易的难点与应对

交易这些非常强劲的趋势日最困难的部分是，趋势在形成时看起来并不特别强劲。通常没有令人印象深刻的**急涨**或容易、高概率的回调到**移动平均线**。相反，市场每隔几根K线就会出现回调，并且有许多反方向的趋势K线。它通常处于一个看起来很弱的通道中。初学者未能看到的是，回调都很小，市场似乎从未回到**移动平均线**，并且价格一直在缓慢地远离开盘价。经验丰富的交易者将所有这些都视为牛市趋势非常强劲的迹象，这给了他们进行**波段交易**的信心。他们正确地知道，尽管K线看起来像是弱势通道的一部分，因此应该产生低概率的**交易机会**，但当它们出现在**小幅回调牛市趋势日**中时，它们形成了高概率的**波段交易机会**。**开盘即趋势日**中的所有回调都是很好的**顺势入场**，即使它们几乎总是看起来很弱。即使回调最终突破了有意义的趋势线，交易者也可以继续有信心**顺势入场**。在强劲的牛市趋势中，寻找在当前K线低点或其低点下方一两个跳动点买入，或者在**高1**和**高2交易机会**上方一个跳动点以**止损单**买入。观察趋势开始以来回调的大小。例如，在Emini的**小幅回调牛市趋势**中，如果过去几个小时最大回调只有八个跳动点，则以**限价单**在当天高点下方五到七个跳动点买入。在强劲的熊市趋势中，交易者会反向操作，在当前K线高点或其上方一两个跳动点做空，在**低1**和**低2信号K线**下方一个跳动点以**止损单**做空，并在任何大约平均K线大小的反弹时做空。

---

##### 趋势惯性与首次突破的意义

市场具有**惯性**，第一次试图结束趋势通常会失败。一旦趋势线被突破并出现显著回调，那么趋势的第一“腿”可能就结束了。即便如此，趋势线的第一次突破仍有很高的几率形成**顺势入场**，这将导致第二“腿”趋势和趋势中的新极端。

---

##### 弱势信号与交易者陷阱

回调通常有弱势**信号K线**，并且有许多**逆势趋势K线**。例如，在强劲的牛市趋势中，大多数买入**信号K线**可能是小的**熊市趋势K线**或**十字星K线**，并且几个入场K线可能是带有小实体的**外包上涨K线**。它们通常出现在两到三根连续**熊市趋势K线**或**熊市微通道**之后。这种持续的卖压使得许多交易者寻找卖出信号，从而将他们困在牛市趋势之外。卖出信号看起来从未足够强劲，但交易者仍然卖出，因为它们看起来比买入信号好，而且他们想交易。他们看到几乎每个买入信号之后都会有回调，回调回来并触及盈亏平衡止损，并认为这是弱势牛市趋势的迹象。他们看到这是一个牛市趋势，并想做多，但不知道如何做，因为他们认为每个买入信号都看起来很糟糕。回调太小，**交易机会**太弱。此外，由于这些日子每月只发生几次，他们习惯了其他日子，那时卖压通常会导致可交易的做空，因此他们继续做空那些看起来不太对劲的**交易机会**。它们看起来不对劲，因为它们是**牛旗**的开始，而不是反转。然而，当经验丰富的交易者看到一个牛市趋势，回调很小，无法跌破**移动平均线**，同时有许多**熊市趋势K线**和弱势买入信号时，他们明白正在发生什么。他们看到交易者被困在做多之外，并被愚弄到不断寻找顶部，并知道这个牛市趋势特别强劲。经验丰富的交易者知道，太多的交易者将做他们不应该做的事情，并被迫退出亏损的空头头寸并追涨。这在上涨方面造成了无情的紧张局面，许多交易者想买但没有买，而经验丰富的交易者则无情地买入，并度过了非常有利可图的一天。

---

##### 紧密通道中的止损管理与新手错误

这些日子通常在相对紧密的通道中，如果交易者希望**波段交易**，他们不应该过于急切地将止损移动到盈亏平衡点。当趋势处于紧密通道中时，它通常会在达到新的趋势极端之前回到入场价格，而不熟练、害怕的交易者会错误地让自己被困在强劲趋势之外。例如，如果存在一个强劲的牛市趋势，市场通常会在五到十根K线内回到**信号K线**高点处的入场价格，并且通常会向下**一两个跳动点**。这会让初学者感到紧张。他们已经有足够的利润进行**剥头皮交易**，但由于当天是趋势日，他们想**波段交易**以获得更大的利润。现在，一小时后，市场回到了入场价格。他们担心了一个小时，因为市场没有在入场价格上方上涨太多，他们现在害怕他们的赢家会变成输家。他们无法再忍受痛苦，以小幅利润或亏损退出。几根K线后，他们感到沮丧，因为市场现在处于新高，他们处于观望状态，被困在一个很棒的交易之外，等待买入下一次回调。他们应该只在市场回调到**信号K线**高点区域，然后反弹到新高之后，才将**保护性止损**跟踪在最近的摆动低点下方。趋势倾向于具有趋势性的高点和低点，因此一旦牛市趋势创出新高，交易者就会将**保护性止损**提高到最近的摆动低点下方。由于他们预期趋势性的低点，他们希望下一次回调保持在上次回调上方。如果市场开始进入一个**交易区间**，回调将跌破先前的更高低点，然后他们将调整为**交易区间**交易风格（在第二本书中讨论）。

---

##### 跳空开盘与第一根K线的交易机会

如果**跳空开盘**不仅仅是几个跳动点，并且第一根K线是一根强劲的**趋势K线**（影线小，K线大小合适），那么交易其任一方向的**突破**通常都是一个好的**交易机会**。每天的第一根K线都是**开盘即趋势的牛市日**和**开盘即趋势的熊市日**的**信号K线**，具体取决于K线**突破**的方向。如果您入场并且您的**保护性止损**在下一根K线被触发，请考虑反转进行**波段交易**，因为市场通常会移动超过您在第一次入场时损失的跳动点数，并且总有可能它会演变为**开盘即趋势日**。

---

##### 无跳空开盘时的第一根K线交易

即使没有**跳空开盘**，第一根K线是**趋势K线**也是一个好的**交易机会**；但如果有**跳空**，成功率会更高，因为市场更显过度，任何走势都会趋于更强劲。

>The market formed a bull trend from the open in Figure 23.1, and the bar 2 break below the trend line was the first pullback. Traders bought on a stop at one tickabove its high, even though it was a weak signal bar (bear close, but at least the close was above the midpoint). Aggressive bulls bought on a limit order at the low of the bar before bar 2, anticipating a failed micro channel breakout and higher prices.It was reasonable but aggressive to short below the first bar of the day because it was a bear trend bar and there was a gap up, and there was room to the movingaverage and to yesterday's close. However, yesterday ended with several strong bull trend bars in the final hour, which is a sign of buying pressure. When there is any doubt, especially on the open, it is better to wait for more information or until one side is trapped. The problem with this initial short is that most traders would not have been able to change their mind-set quickly enough to reverse to long above bar 2. They would have been trapped out; most would have waited to buy above the first pullback, and that later entry would have cost them several points of profit.

##### 开盘牛市趋势与首次回调买入

在图23.1中，市场形成了一个**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势**，第2根K线跌破**趋势线**是第一次回调。交易者在其高点上方一个跳动点以**止损单**买入，尽管它是一个弱势**信号K线**（看跌收盘，但至少收盘价高于中点）。激进的多头在第2根K线之前的K线低点以**限价单**买入，预期微型通道**突破**失败和价格上涨。

---

##### 早期做空机会的风险与陷阱

在当天第一根K线下方做空是合理但激进的，因为它是一根**熊市趋势K线**，存在一个**跳空高开**，并且与**移动平均线**以及昨天的收盘价之间有空间。然而，昨天在最后一小时以几根强劲的**牛市趋势K线**收盘，这是买盘压力的迹象。当有任何疑问时，尤其是在开盘时，最好等待更多信息，或者直到一方被困住。这种初始做空的问题在于，大多数交易者无法足够快地改变他们的心态，以便在第2根K线上方反转做多。他们会被困住；大多数人会等待在第一次回调上方买入，而这种较晚的入场会让他们损失好几个点的利润。

>A trend from the open day is the strongest type of trend day, and a small pullback day is the strongest type of trend from the open day. Trend from the open days occur about once or twice a week, but small pullback days (seen in Figure 23.2) form only once or twice a month.The average daily range in the Eminis had been about 12 points, and by bar 9 the biggest pullback of the day was only nine ticks. The pullback to bar 11 was only 11 ticks. Smart bulls saw this and therefore placed limit orders to buy maybe from six to 10 ticks down from the most recent high. Their initial stops might have been a couple of points. The market tried to create a larger pullback in the move down to bar 17 but could not drive the market down more than 14 ticks. Bulls saw the large bull trend bar before bar 14 as a possible buy climax, and many exited longs. A sudden surge that was likely to be followed by a pullback is a great opportunity to exit at a very good price that was likely to be brief. Other experienced traders shorted the close of the bar and the close of bar 14 and the next bar, since they had tails on the top, which is a sign of selling pressure. These traders expected a two-legged pullback lasting about 10 bars, and almost certainly a test of the moving average, since the market already tested it at bars 9 and 11. On a small pullback trend day, the market usually has a pullback sometime after 11:00 a.m. PST that is about twice the size of the largest pullback of the day.
>There was a 20 gap bar long above bar 9 and the bulls bought the moving average tests at bars 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, and 19. There was not a strong sell signal all day, but aggressive bears could have scalped below the inside bar after bar 14. However, most traders instead would have looked to buy pullbacks instead of shorting new highs since this was such a strong bull trend day.
>The market had a strong bull spike up from bar 2 and then the rest of the day was a bull channel. Traders became always-in long on bar 2 or on the strong bull trend bar that followed.Most of the channel was a slightly upward-sloping tight trading range with very little price gain, which is often the case on small pullback days. The high of the day was only four points above the bar 5 high at 8:25 a.m.
>As is the case with all strong trends, most of the buy signal bars looked bad. This kept bulls from buying, trapping them out, and they ended up having to chase the market higher. It also kept shorts from exiting, and they were trapped into larger and larger losses. There were also many bear trend bars and bear spikes. This selling pressure made beginning traders look for reversal setups and not take buy signals. Experienced, unemotional traders understand that bad buy signal bars and bear trend bars in a trend day with very small pullbacks are signs of a very strong bull trend. They made sure to buy despite the weak setups. They bought on bar 2as it broke above the doji high 1 signal bar. They bought again as bar 4 reversed up into an outside bar after forming a double bottom with the bull reversal bar from seven bars earlier.They bought the high 2 above bar 8 and above the bull bar that followed it, which created a two-bar reversal.
>Bar 9 was a triangle (bars 6 and 8 were the first two pushes down) in a bull trend day and therefore a bull flag buy setup. They bought above the bar 11 bear trend bar that closed below the moving average, because it was a failed one-tick breakout below the bars 8 and 9 double bottom. It was also a pullback from the breakout to bar 10 of the triangle. At this point, the market was in a trading range, so most bulls would not have exited on a breakout below. They know that most breakout attempts fail and that most trading ranges in bull trends are bull flags and will ultimately break out of the top of the range. Most bulls either would have exited their longs below the bear bars after bar 10 or would have used the bottom of the most recent bull spike for their protective stops. For example, they might have had their stops at one tick below bar 4 or below the outside up bar that formed three bars later.
>Usually, when there is a bear micro channel, like the one from bar 10 to bar 11, it is better to buy a pullback from the breakout, but there is a sense of urgency when the trend is strong,and smart traders are unwilling to wait for perfection because they don't want to risk missing the move. They also bought above the bear bar after bar 13, even though it had a bear body. It was a high 2 buy setup (the high 1 was the bull bar after bar 12) and a second-entry breakout pullback buy setup from the breakout above the bear micro channel down from bar 10 (the high 1 was the first setup). They bought again as bar 17 became an outside up bar, even though it followed a small doji bar and a big bear trend bar. The moving average was continuing to contain all sell-offs. They bought above the bar 17 bull doji, and above the bull bar that followed it. They bought above the bear bar after bar 19 because it was another small high 2 at the moving average. It was a bear bar, and the first leg down was made of the two bear bars after bar 18. Others bought on a stop above bar 19 because it was a bull bar in a pullback to the moving average in a strong bull trend.
>The market spent most the day trying to reverse down, running stops on the bulls and trapping beginners into losing shorts, but relentlessly forming higher highs and lows, opening near the low of the day and closing near the high of the day. The buy setups all looked like they were low probability, and this trapped inexperienced bulls out. However, experienced traders knew what was going on and bought every sharp sell-off all day. They realized that, as bad as the long setups looked, the trend was so strong that the probability of success was much higher than it appeared.

##### 强势趋势的识别与交易：小幅回调日的特点

**开盘即趋势日**是最强劲的趋势日类型，而**小幅回调日**则是**开盘即趋势日**中最强劲的类型。**开盘即趋势日**大约每周出现一到两次，但**小幅回调日**（如图23.2所示）每月只出现一到两次。Emini的平均日波动范围约为12点，而到第9根K线时，当天最大回调仅为九个跳动点。到第11根K线的回调也只有11个跳动点。聪明的多头看到了这一点，因此设置**限价单**，可能从最近高点向下六到十个跳动点买入。他们最初的止损可能是几个点。市场在下跌到第17根K线时试图制造更大的回调，但未能将市场推低超过14个跳动点。多头将第14根K线之前的大型**牛市趋势K线**视为可能的**买入高潮**，许多人因此了结了多头头寸。这种突然的上涨很可能随后出现回调，是**在高位**退出的绝佳机会，这种高位通常是短暂的。其他经验丰富的交易者在K线收盘时、以及第14根K线和下一根K线收盘时做空，因为它们的顶部有影线，这是卖压的迹象。这些交易者预期会有一个持续约10根K线的**两“腿”回调**，并且几乎肯定会测试**移动平均线**，因为市场已经在第9和11根K线处测试过它。在**小幅回调趋势日**中，市场通常会在太平洋时间上午11:00之后的某个时候出现一次回调，其大小约为当天最大回调的两倍。

---

##### 强劲牛市中的买入机会

在第9根K线上方有一个**20跳空K线做多**，多头在第8、9、11、13、17和19根K线处买入了**移动平均线测试**。全天没有出现强劲的卖出信号，但激进的空头可以在第14根K线之后的**内包K线**下方**剥头皮**做空。然而，大多数交易者会选择买入回调，而不是做空新高，因为这是一个非常强劲的**牛市趋势日**。

---

##### 小幅回调日的通道特征

市场从第2根K线开始出现强劲的**牛市急涨**，然后当天剩余时间是一个**牛市通道**。交易者在第2根K线或随后的强劲**牛市趋势K线**上变得**总是处于做多**状态。通道的大部分是略微向上倾斜的紧密**交易区间**，价格上涨非常小，这在**小幅回调日**中经常出现。当天的高点仅比太平洋时间上午8:25第5根K线的高点高出四点。

---

##### 弱势信号下的强势趋势

与所有强劲趋势一样，大多数买入**信号K线**看起来都很糟糕。这使得多头不敢买入，将他们困在场外，最终他们不得不追涨。这也阻止了空头平仓，他们被困在越来越大的亏损中。此外，还有许多**熊市趋势K线**和**熊市急涨**。这种卖压使得初学者寻找反转**交易机会**，而不去执行买入信号。经验丰富、不情绪化的交易者明白，在回调非常小的趋势日中，糟糕的买入**信号K线**和**熊市趋势K线**是强劲牛市趋势的迹象。他们确保尽管**交易机会**看起来很弱，也仍坚持买入。他们在第2根K线突破**十字星高1信号K线**高点时买入。他们在第4根K线反转向上形成**外包K线**（在与七根K线前的**牛市反转K线**形成**双重底**之后）时再次买入。他们在第8根K线上方以及随后的牛市K线上方买入**高2**，这形成了**两K线反转**。

---

##### 交易区间内的买入策略与止损

第9根K线是一个**三角形**（第6和8根K线是前两次下跌推动），在牛市趋势日中，因此是一个**牛旗买入交易机会**。他们在第11根K线**熊市趋势K线**收盘价低于**移动平均线**上方买入，因为它是在第8和9根K线**双重底**下方的一次失败的单跳动点**突破**。它也是从**三角形**突破到第10根K线的回调。此时，市场处于**交易区间**，因此大多数多头不会在跌破时退出。他们知道大多数**突破**尝试都会失败，并且牛市趋势中的大多数**交易区间**都是**牛旗**，最终会向上突破区间的顶部。大多数多头要么在第10根K线后的**熊市K线**下方了结多头头寸，要么将**保护性止损**设置在最近牛市**急涨**的底部下方。例如，他们可能将止损设置在第4根K线下方一个跳动点，或者在三根K线之后形成的**外包上涨K线**下方。

---

##### 交易者的心态与市场行为

通常，当出现**熊市微通道**时，例如从第10根K线到第11根K线的那个，最好在**突破**后买入回调，但当趋势强劲时会有一种紧迫感，聪明的交易者不愿意等待完美，因为他们不想冒错过走势的风险。他们还在第13根K线之后的**熊市K线**上方买入，尽管它有一个**熊市实体**。它是一个**高2买入交易机会**（**高1**是第12根K线之后的牛市K线），并且是从第10根K线向下**熊市微通道**突破后的**二次入场突破回调买入交易机会**（**高1**是第一个**交易机会**）。当第17根K线变成**外包上涨K线**时，他们再次买入，尽管它前面是一个小型**十字星K线**和一根大型**熊市趋势K线**。**移动平均线**继续限制所有抛售。他们在第17根K线**牛市十字星**上方和随后的牛市K线上方买入。他们在第19根K线之后的**熊市K线**上方买入，因为它是在**移动平均线**处的另一个**小型高2**。它是一根**熊市K线**，第一“腿”下跌由第18根K线后的两根**熊市K线**组成。其他人则在第19根K线上方以**止损单**买入，因为它是在强劲牛市趋势中回调到**移动平均线**处的牛市K线。

---

##### 市场陷阱与经验交易者的优势

市场全天大部分时间都在试图向下反转，触发多头的止损，并将初学者困入亏损的空头头寸，但却无情地形成更高的高点和低点，开盘接近当天低点，收盘接近当天高点。所有的买入**交易机会**看起来都像是低概率的，这使得没有经验的多头被困在场外。然而，经验丰富的交易者明白正在发生什么，并在全天买入每一次急剧抛售。他们意识到，尽管做多**交易机会**看起来再糟糕，但趋势如此强劲，以至于成功的概率远高于表面。

---

>When there is a trend from the open and all of the pullbacks are less than 20 to 30 percent of the recent average daily range, the day is a small pullback day, which is the strongest type of trend day. There is usually a pullback later in the day that is about 150 to 200 percent larger than the size of the earlier pullbacks, and that was the case here in the OIH (see Figure 23.3).Any sideways movement was a pause and a type of pullback and was a buy setup. The ii breakout at bar 1 was a good entry, and the bar 3 breakout of the two-legged sideways correction was another. Finally, there was the tight trading range breakout at bar 4. All of these entries should be considered to be part of the first up leg and not a first pullback, which comes after the first leg and sets up the second leg. Rarely, days just don't seem to pull back and traders are forced to enter on breakouts from even brief sideways pauses. The reality is that on strong days like this you can just buy at the market at any point, trusting that even if there is a reversal, the odds are overwhelming that the market will make another high before the pullback retraces very far. Many traders buy the closes of bull and bear trend bars and at or below the low of the prior bar.

##### **小幅回调日的特征与强劲趋势**

当出现**开盘即趋势**的走势，并且所有回调都小于近期平均日波动范围的20%到30%时，当天就是**小幅回调日**，这是最强劲的趋势日类型。通常在当天晚些时候会出现一次回调，其幅度比早期的回调大150%到200%，OIH（参见图23.3）就是这种情况。任何横向移动都是暂停和一种回调，并且是一个买入**交易机会**。第1根K线的ii**突破**是一个很好的入场点，而第3根K线的**两“腿”横向修正**的**突破**是另一个入场点。最后，在第4根K线处出现了紧密**交易区间突破**。所有这些入场都应被视为第一“腿”上涨的一部分，而不是第一次回调，第一次回调出现在第一“腿”之后并为第二“腿”做准备。很少情况下，市场似乎就是不回调，交易者被迫甚至在短暂的横向暂停后的**突破**处入场。现实是，在像这样的强劲日子里，您可以在任何时候市价买入，相信即使出现反转，市场在回调大幅回撤之前创出新高的可能性也是压倒性的。许多交易者会在牛市和**熊市趋势K线**收盘时，以及在当前K线低点或以下买入。

---

>In a strong trend, determining which pullback is the first significant pullback is often difficult to do. When that is the case, the odds are very high that your trade will be profitable because an unclear pullback means the countertrend traders are very weak. In Figure 23.4, bars 2 and 3were tiny pullbacks that did not break a meaningful trend line. The first pullback to break a trend line was bar 4. The first trend line break has a very good chance of being followed by another trend leg and is therefore a great entry (like shorting below the bar 4 bear trend bar).Today was a small pullback type of trend from the open bear trend day.

![[Pasted image 20250711002926.png]]

---

##### **强劲趋势中的回调判断与交易机会**

在强劲趋势中，确定哪个回调是第一个显著回调通常很难。在这种情况下，您的交易盈利概率会非常高，因为不明确的回调意味着**逆势交易者**非常弱势。在图23.4中，第2和第3根K线是微小的回调，它们没有突破有意义的**趋势线**。第一个突破**趋势线**的回调是第4根K线。第一次**趋势线突破**很有可能随后出现另一“腿”趋势，因此是一个很好的入场**交易机会**（例如在第4根K线**熊市趋势K线**下方做空）。今天是一个**小幅回调型开盘即趋势的熊市趋势日**。

---

>Sometimes the first bar of the day can trap traders into entering in the wrong direction, and the day can then become a strong trend day in the opposite direction. In Figure 23.5, the market gapped below yesterday's low and broke out of a large trading range formed over the second half of yesterday (a head and shoulders top bear flag). The first bar today, bar 9, was a bull trend bar, which usually would lead to a partial gap closure or even a bull trend. Many went long on a stop at one tick above its high. However, the market trapped those longs two bars later when it traded below its low. That bull trend bar trapped bulls in and bears out because traders assumed that its strength was a sign that the market was going to try to close the gap and maybe become a bull trend day. It tried to reverse up from the breakout below yesterday's trading range and from breaking below the trend channel line. You have to be very flexible on the open and assume that the exact opposite of what you believed a minute ago can happen. You want to be able to see what is happening as early as it is happening so that you can enter as early as possible. The market tried to reverse back up above the trend channel line and failed, and this two-bar breakout pullback could lead to some kind of measured move down. If the day becomes a trend day and you miss the earliest entry, there will be chances to enter all day long.

##### **首根K线陷阱与趋势反转**

有时，当天的第一根K线可能会诱使交易者向错误的方向入场，然后当天可能形成一个方向相反的强劲趋势日。在图23.5中，市场**跳空低开**至昨天低点下方，并突破了昨天后半段形成的一个大型**交易区间**（一个**头肩顶熊旗**）。今天的第一根K线，即第9根K线，是一根**牛市趋势K线**，这通常会导致部分**跳空**回补，甚至形成牛市趋势。许多交易者在其高点上方一个跳动点以**止损单**做多。然而，两根K线后，当市场跌破其低点时，它困住了那些多头。那根**牛市趋势K线**困住了多头，并使空头无法入场，因为交易者认为其强势是一个迹象，表明市场将尝试回补**跳空**，并可能成为一个牛市趋势日。它试图从跌破昨天**交易区间**以及跌破**趋势通道线**的反转向上。在开盘时您必须非常灵活，并假定一分钟前您所相信的完全相反的情况可能会发生。您希望能够在事情发生时尽早看到它，以便尽早入场。市场试图反转回到**趋势通道线**上方并失败了，这种两K线**突破回调**可能导致某种**量度移动**下跌。如果当天成为一个趋势日，并且您错过了最早的入场机会，那么全天都会有入场机会。

---

>Bar 10 provided a great opportunity to go short at one tick below the low of the bar 9 bull trend bar because this is where most of those trapped longs would get out, driving the market down. Also, any potential buyers would be waiting for more price action, so there were only sellers in the market, making for a high-probability short. Shorts added on at the bear flags along that way that trapped other early longs into believing that the market was bottoming.
>Traders became confident that the market was always-in short by the close of bar 11, which confirmed the downside breakout. Many traders were confident of the always-in trade at the close of the bear breakout bar, just before bar 11.
>Despite all of the reversal attempts, the market closed on its low. This is a good example of why it is important to try to swing at least part of your trade when you see a strong trend from the open day. If you do take long trades, you have to force yourself to get back on the short side as you exit your longs because you don't want to miss out on a huge short just to catch a small long.

>Bar 1 2 was a strong bull reversal bar in Figure 23.5, but it largely overlapped the prior two bars and therefore it was part of a small trading range and was not functioning as a reversal bar, despite its appearance. Reversal bars always have to be judged in context, and when they overlap the prior bars by too much they are part of a small trading range, and buying above a trading range in a bear trend is a losing strategy. Smart traders are doing just the opposite.They have limit orders to go short at and above the high of the prior bar, even if the bar has a strong bull body.
>Bar 1 3 was a low 2 short setup but the signal bar was a small doji. A doji is a weak signal bar,and weak setups often mean that the market is not yet ready to break out. However, in a strong bear trend like this, you can short for any reason and just use a wider stop. You could also go short below the bar 12 or bar 11 lows. In a strong bear trend, you can sell below the lows of bars and below swing lows and expect to make a profit.
>Bar 14 was an attempt to reverse up after the failed low 2 and was therefore the third push up.The doji after bar 11 was the first push and bar 1 2 was the second. A third push up in a bear flag creates a wedge bear flag, so it is reasonable to short below its low.
>This bar 14 failed low 2 buy setup illustrates one of the worst things that a trader can do,which is buying above a weak bar in a bear flag in search of a scalper's profit. You will not only lose on the scalp, but your mind-set will be that of a buyer. You will not be mentally prepared to short the breakout of the bear flag, which has a much higher chance of success and is more likely to result in a swing trade and not just a scalp.
>The bar 15 breakout bar was a strong bear trend bar and a statement that the bears controlled the market. When there is a strong bear breakout like this, there will usually be at least two more legs down in the form of a bear channel, and those two additional legs often create a wedge bear flag. This usually leads to a two-legged correction, as it did here in the rally to the moving average at bar 22.
>Bar 22 was a bear reversal bar at the moving average and a low 2 short. It was also a 20 gap bar short and a wedge bear flag where the push up to bar 19 was the first leg up in the wedge.The market sold off to a new bear low at the two-bar reversal at bar 25. It was also a reversal up from a one-bar final flag and a high 2 buy signal at the bottom of a developing trading range.
>Bar 2 7 was a strong bull trend bar and an attempt to form an upside breakout, but it formed a double top bear flag with bar 22.The bar 28 ii pattern became a final flag as the market reversed down from the small bar 29lower high and moving average gap bar short setup.Bar 30 was a two-legged higher low test of the bear low.
>The bear rally ended with awedgebearflag at bar 35, where bars 27 and 33 were the first two pushes up. The higher highs trapped bulls in and bears out, but alert traders were prepared for the bear day to resume, and they noticed how bar 35 missed the breakeven stops on the shorts below bar 11. This means that the strongest bears were reasserting themselves. They took over the market on the strong bar 15 bear spike; they were sitting on the sidelines,waiting for a test, and then they appeared out of nowhere and drove the market down into the close.

##### **高概率做空机会与空头加仓**

第10根K线提供了一个绝佳的做空**交易机会**，即在第9根**牛市趋势K线**低点下方一个跳动点做空，因为这是大多数被困多头会离场的位置，从而推动市场下跌。此外，任何潜在的买家都会等待更多的价格行为，所以市场上只有卖家，从而形成了一个高概率的做空**交易机会**。空头在沿途的**熊旗**处加仓，这些**熊旗**诱使其他早期多头相信市场正在筑底。

---

##### **空头信心确立与日内趋势**

交易者在第11根K线收盘时确信市场**总是处于做空**状态，这确认了下行**突破**。许多交易者在第11根K线之前的**熊市突破K线**收盘时就对“总是处于”的交易方向充满信心。

尽管所有的反转尝试，市场收盘在低点。这是一个很好的例子，说明了当您看到一个强劲的**开盘即趋势日**时，为什么尝试**波段交易**至少一部分头寸很重要。如果您确实进行多头交易，您必须强迫自己在退出多头头寸时重新回到空头一方，因为您不想为了抓住一个小幅多头而错过一次巨大的做空机会。

---

##### **图表深度解析：反转K线的解读**

图23.5中，第12根K线是一根强劲的**牛市反转K线**，但它与前两根K线大部分重叠，因此它是一个**小交易区间**的一部分，尽管其外观如此，但并没有起到反转K线的作用。**反转K线**总是必须结合上下文进行判断，当它们与前几根K线重叠过多时，它们就是**小交易区间**的一部分，而在熊市趋势中在**交易区间**上方买入是一种亏损策略。聪明的交易者正在做相反的事情。他们设置**限价单**在当前K线高点及上方做空，即使这根K线具有强劲的**牛市实体**。

---

##### **弱势信号下的做空策略**

第13根K线是一个**低2做空交易机会**，但**信号K线**是一个小型**十字星**。**十字星**是弱势**信号K线**，弱势**交易机会**通常意味着市场尚未准备好**突破**。然而，在这种强劲的熊市趋势中，您可以出于任何原因做空，只需使用更宽的止损。您也可以在第12根或第11根K线低点下方做空。在强劲的熊市趋势中，您可以在K线低点和摆动低点下方卖出，并预期盈利。

---

##### **楔形熊旗与交易者错误**

第14根K线是在**低2**失败后试图反转向上，因此是第三次向上推动。第11根K线之后的**十字星**是第一次推动，第12根K线是第二次。**熊旗**中的第三次向上推动形成了**楔形熊旗**，因此在其低点下方做空是合理的。

这个第14根K线失败的**低2买入交易机会**说明了交易者可能做的最糟糕的事情之一，即在**熊旗**中在一根弱势K线上方买入以寻求**剥头皮利润**。您不仅会在**剥头皮交易**中亏损，而且您的心态将是买家的心态。您将无法在精神上准备好做空**熊旗**的**突破**，而**熊旗突破**成功的机会要高得多，并且更有可能导致**波段交易**而不仅仅是**剥头皮交易**。

---

##### **强劲突破与后续修正**

第15根K线**突破K线**是一根强劲的**熊市趋势K线**，表明空头控制了市场。当出现这种强劲的熊市**突破**时，通常会至少出现两“腿”下跌，形成**熊市通道**，这两“腿”通常会形成**楔形熊旗**。这通常会导致**两“腿”修正**，就像这里反弹到第22根K线**移动平均线**处所发生的那样。

---

##### **多重信号下的做空机会**

第22根K线是**移动平均线**处的**熊市反转K线**和**低2做空**。它也是一个**20跳空K线做空**和**楔形熊旗**，其中上涨到第19根K线是**楔形**中的第一“腿”上涨。市场抛售至第25根K线两K线反转处的熊市新低。它也是从单K线**最终旗形**向上反转，以及正在形成的**交易区间**底部的一个**高2买入信号**。

---

##### **双重顶熊旗与市场重归空头**

第27根K线是一根强劲的**牛市趋势K线**，是试图形成向上**突破**的尝试，但它与第22根K线形成了**双重顶熊旗**。第28根K线的ii形态在市场从小型第29根K线**更低高点**和**移动平均线跳空K线做空交易机会**向下反转时，成为了一个**最终旗形**。第30根K线是**熊市低点**的**两“腿”更高低点测试**。

熊市反弹以第35根K线处的**楔形熊旗**结束，其中第27和33根K线是前两次向上推动。更高的高点困住了多头，并使空头无法入场，但警惕的交易者为熊市趋势的恢复做好了准备，他们注意到第35根K线如何错过了第11根K线下方空头的盈亏平衡止损。这意味着最强劲的空头正在重新占据主导地位。他们在第15根K线强劲的**熊市急涨**中控制了市场；他们一直在场边等待测试，然后他们突然出现，并将市场推向收盘时的低点。

>Here, in Figure 23.6, are three consecutive gap openings but with different results, even though the first bar on each day was a bear trend bar. Bars 1 and 9 were also gap openings on the daily chart.
>Bar 1 had no tail at the top and a small tail on the bottom and was a large bear trend bar,which is a good short setup on a day with a large gap up open. It was followed by a strong bear entry bar. If the first bar of the day is a strong trend bar (see thumbnail), there will usually be follow-through, and when the first two bars are strong, an attempted reversal up usually becomes a lower high, as it did here. A large gap up with strong selling usually becomes a trend from the open bear trend day. There was a sharp rally to bar 3 that tested the open, but this failed opening reversal resulted in a lower high or a double top, and then a lengthy down move.Bar 2 was an attempt to form a breakout pullback from the breakout above yesterday's high,but the bears were too strong and the rally failed at bar 3.
>Two bars after bar 6 was a strong bull reversal bar, and an opening reversal after a bear trend bar on the open broke below the bull channel of the final two hours of the day before. A bull channel is a bear flag, and the bull reversal bar that formed two bars after bar 6 was an attempt to have the breakout of the bear flag fail. Shorting below the first bar of the day was risky here, even though it was a bear trend bar, because the bar was at the level of a trading range at the end of yesterday and shorting at the bottom of a trading range is usually a losing strategy, especially in a market where there is no clear direction (a trading range).
>The sharp rally up to bar 7 tested the close of the prior day and formed a lower high or a double top. The bear signal bar made this a good short. Pullbacks happen when bulls take profits. Why do traders ever take profits when a trend is strong? Because no matter how strong a trend is, it can have a deep pullback that would allow traders to enter again at a much better price, and sometimes the trend can reverse. If they did not take at least partial profits, they would then watch their big profit disappear and even turn into a loss.
>Bar 9 gapped below the low of the prior day and formed a bear trend bar, but it had big tails,indicating that traders bought into the close of the bar. The second bar was a bear trend bar with a close on its low, indicating that the bears were strong, but it was followed by a strong bull trend bar, forming a reversal. Although the long did not trigger, this was again evidence that the bears lacked urgency. When the gap is this large, everyone knows that the behavior is extreme and if there is no immediate follow-through, the market will reverse quickly to undo this extreme situation.
>Bar 10 was a large bear trend bar and therefore a sell climax. The next bar was an inside bar and this created a breakout mode situation. If there was no immediate follow-through selling,the bears would aggressively begin to buy back their shorts and look to sell higher, and bulls would buy, hoping for a low of the day. The market had been in a large bear channel for a couple of days and it was at the bottom of the channel, so there was a good chance that it would reverse up and a smaller chance that it would break through the bottom of the bear channel and form an even steeper bear trend. The channel lines are not shown, but the bear trend line is above the bar 1 and bar 7 highs and the bear trend channel line is a best fit line that could be drawn along the bar 4 and bar 8 lows. Bulls also bought above bull trend bars,like above the bull trend bar before bar 10 and the bull trend bar that formed two bars after bar 10. They would also buy above the small inside bar after bar 12, since that would be a failed low 2. Since this is a possible reversal up from the low of the day and the bottom of a two-day bull flag (a bear channel is a bull flag), it is a good buy setup.

##### **连续跳空开盘与首根K线陷阱**

如图23.6所示，这里是三次连续的**跳空开盘**，尽管每天的第一根K线都是**熊市趋势K线**，但结果却各不相同。第1根和第9根K线在日线图上也是**跳空开盘**。

---

##### **大型跳空高开后的熊市趋势日**

第1根K线顶部没有影线，底部有小影线，并且是一根大型**熊市趋势K线**，这在**大幅跳空高开**的日子里是一个好的做空**交易机会**。随后是一根强劲的**熊市入场K线**。如果当天的第一根K线是强劲的**趋势K线**（见缩略图），通常会有**跟进动量**，当头两根K线都很强劲时，试图向上反转通常会形成**更低高点**，就像这里一样。**大幅跳空高开**伴随着强劲的抛售，通常会成为**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势日**。第3根K线出现了一次剧烈反弹，测试了开盘价，但这次**失败的开盘反转**导致了**更低高点**或**双重顶**，然后是漫长的下跌。第2根K线试图形成**突破回调**（从突破昨天高点开始），但空头过于强劲，反弹在第3根K线处失败。

---

##### **熊市趋势中的做空风险与反转尝试**

第6根K线后的两根K线是一根强劲的**牛市反转K线**，并且在开盘时**熊市趋势K线**之后的一次**开盘反转**跌破了前一天最后两小时的**牛市通道**。**牛市通道**是**熊旗**，而第6根K线后两根K线形成的**牛市反转K线**是试图使**熊旗**的**突破**失败。在这里，在当天第一根K线下方做空是有风险的，即使它是一根**熊市趋势K线**，因为这根K线处于昨天收盘时**交易区间**的水平，而在**交易区间**底部做空通常是一种亏损策略，尤其是在方向不明确的市场中（**交易区间**）。

---

##### **强劲趋势中的获利了结**

上涨到第7根K线的剧烈反弹测试了前一天的收盘价，并形成了**更低高点**或**双重顶**。**熊市信号K线**使其成为一个好的做空**交易机会**。回调发生在多头获利了结时。为什么交易者在趋势强劲时仍要获利了结？因为无论趋势多么强劲，它都可能出现深度回调，这将使交易者能够以更好的价格再次入场，有时趋势甚至可能反转。如果他们没有至少部分获利了结，他们就会眼睁睁看着巨大的利润消失，甚至变成亏损。

---

##### **跳空开盘后的市场行为与潜在反转**

第9根K线**跳空低开**至前一天低点下方，并形成了一根**熊市趋势K线**，但它有很大的影线，表明交易者在K线收盘时买入。第二根K线是一根**熊市趋势K线**，收盘在最低点，表明空头强劲，但随后是一根强劲的**牛市趋势K线**，形成了反转。尽管多头没有被触发，但这再次证明空头缺乏紧迫性。当**跳空**如此之大时，每个人都知道这种行为是极端的，如果没有立即的**跟进动量**，市场将迅速反转以消除这种极端情况。

---

##### **熊市高潮与通道底部反转**

第10根K线是一根大型**熊市趋势K线**，因此是一次**卖出高潮**。下一根K线是**内包K线**，这创造了一个**突破模式**局面。如果没有立即的**跟进抛售**，空头会积极地回补空头头寸，并寻求在更高价格卖出，而多头会买入，希望形成当天低点。市场已经在一个大型**熊市通道**中运行了两天，并且处于通道的底部，因此它很有可能向上反转，而突破**熊市通道**底部并形成更陡峭的熊市趋势的可能性较小。通道线没有显示，但**熊市趋势线**位于第1根和第7根K线高点上方，而**熊市趋势通道线**是沿第4根和第8根K线低点绘制的最佳拟合线。多头也会在**牛市趋势K线**上方买入，例如在第10根K线之前的**牛市趋势K线**上方以及第10根K线之后两根K线形成的**牛市趋势K线**上方。他们也会在第12根K线之后的小型**内包K线**上方买入，因为那将是一个失败的**低2**。由于这可能是从当天低点和**两日牛旗**底部（**熊市通道**是**牛旗**）向上反转，因此这是一个好的买入**交易机会**。

---

>The market in Figure 23.7 opened with a moderate gap down, which can be near the high or low of the day. Bar 3 was the first bar and it was a bear trend bar and a possible start of a bear trend from the open. The market failed to reverse the bar 2 swing low from yesterday so it would likely test the next level of support from yesterday, which was its low at bar 1. A trader would place an order to go short at one tick below the low of bar 3. Once the market fell below yesterday's low, it was likely to try to reverse up again, at least briefly, so a trader would place an order to go long on a stop at one tick above the first good signal bar. Although some traders would buy above bar 4, it was a bear trend bar with a close below its middle. It would be safer to wait until the next bar closed to see if a better setup would develop. The bar had a good-sized bull body and it formed a two-bar reversal with bar 4. The entry is above its high.In general, it is always better to buy above bull trend bars, especially when trading countertrend.
>If the buy order wasn't filled and the next bar had a lower low, traders would try to buy above its high since they would be looking for a failed breakout below yesterday's low to form an opening reversal. However, if the market fell much further without a good buy setup, traders should only trade shorts until after a rally breaks a trend line.
>The market made a small two-legged rally to the moving average and above the high of the day, where it set up a double top bear flag at the moving average. The large bull trend bar that broke above the bar 4 reversal was followed by a bear bar, which is bad follow-through and a signal that the market might be forming a trading range instead of a bull trend. The market continued in a trading range until midday. Up to that point, the range was about half the size of an average daily range. This alerted traders to the possibility of a breakout, an approximate doubling of the range, and the formation of a trending trading range day. The breakout began with the strong spike down from bar 10. Although not shown, the day ended with a strong reversal, as is often the case on trending trading range days, and it closed back in the tight trading range that began at bar 7. Tight trading ranges are magnets and tend to pull breakouts back into them.

##### **中度跳空低开与早期交易机会**

图23.7中，市场以中度**跳空低开**开盘，这可能接近当天的高点或低点。第3根K线是第一根K线，它是一根**熊市趋势K线**，可能是**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势**的开始。市场未能反转昨天第2根K线的摆动低点，因此很可能会测试昨天下一个支撑位，即其在第1根K线处的低点。交易者会在第3根K线低点下方一个跳动点设置做空订单。一旦市场跌破昨天的低点，它很可能会再次尝试向上反转，至少是短暂的，因此交易者会在第一根好的**信号K线**高点上方一个跳动点设置做多**止损单**。尽管有些交易者会在第4根K线上方买入，但它是一根**熊市趋势K线**，收盘价低于其中点。更安全的方法是等待下一根K线收盘，看看是否会出现更好的**交易机会**。这根K线有一个大小合适的牛市实体，它与第4根K线形成了**两K线反转**。入场点在其高点上方。一般来说，总是最好在**牛市趋势K线**上方买入，尤其是在**逆势交易**时。

---

##### **未成交订单与后续策略**

如果买入订单没有成交，并且下一根K线创出**更低低点**，交易者会尝试在其高点上方买入，因为他们会寻找**突破**昨天低点的失败，以形成**开盘反转**。然而，如果市场在没有好的买入**交易机会**的情况下进一步下跌，交易者应该只进行做空交易，直到反弹突破**趋势线**之后。

---

##### **中期行情：双重顶与交易区间**

市场小幅**两“腿”反弹**至**移动平均线**上方和当日高点上方，并在**移动平均线**处形成了**双重顶熊旗**。突破第4根K线反转的大型**牛市趋势K线**之后是一根**熊市K线**，这是糟糕的**跟进动量**，也是市场可能正在形成**交易区间**而不是牛市趋势的信号。市场继续在**交易区间**内运行直到中午。到那时，波动范围大约是平均日波动范围的一半。这提醒交易者存在**突破**、波动范围大致翻倍以及形成**趋势性交易区间日**的可能性。**突破**始于从第10根K线开始的强劲向下**急涨**。尽管未显示，但当天以强劲反转结束，正如**趋势性交易区间日**经常出现的情况一样，并且收盘时回到了从第7根K线开始的紧密**交易区间**。紧密**交易区间**是**磁体**，倾向于将**突破**拉回其中。

---

>Sometimes, a trend from the open day opens on the highest tick of the day. In Figure 23.8, bar 12 was the first bar of the day and it opened on its high tick and broke out below the wedge from yesterday's close. Most traders would not be nimble enough to sell below the inside bar at the end of yesterday, but it would be reasonable to sell a small position on the close of the first bar. If you missed the first entry, you could look at a 1 minute chart for a small pullback (there were many) to short or simply wait for a 5 minute setup. When there is a trend from the open, selling the first pullback is a high-probability trade, even though it is hard to take since you are selling near the low of a big move down in this case. Bar 15 was the signal bar for that first pullback short, and it was also a pullback that reversed down just below the moving average. The shorts were so eager to get in that they were selling below the moving average without waiting for the market to actually touch the moving average. Some traders would be afraid to short after five bars with bull bodies, but the bodies were small and this was the first pullback after a strong bear spike and therefore a reliable low 1 short setup. It was also a moving average test and a double top bear flag with the bar 13 high.
>The day became a spike and channel bear with the bear channel beginning at bar 15 and also at bar 17 and ending at bar 19. The market rallied into the close and did not close on the low.
>
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>There was other spike and channel behavior in Figure 23.8, as is the case on most days. Bar 1 2and the bar after it formed a spike, as did bar 13 and the bar before bar 14, and the entire move down to bar 14 was a spike. The two bars after bar 15 formed another spike, which was followed by the channel that began with the bar 17 low 2 and ended at bar 19.
>Bar 1 6 was also a breakout pullback from the breakout below bar 14 and bar 1. It was also close enough to a breakout below yesterday's low to behave like a pullback from an actual breakout (close is close enough). The eagerness of the bears to short prevented that first pullback from reaching the moving average. They were afraid that it might not get there and therefore shorted so heavily on the approach that it never reached the moving average target.When the pullback turns back down just below the moving average, the bears are very aggressive and have a sense of urgency. They are very eager to short, even at relatively low prices, so lower prices are likely to follow.
>Bar 1 9 was a spike up, and a channel up began with the bar 20 higher low. The bar after bar 20was also a spike that ended with a three-bar channel at bar 21, the final bar on the chart.
>Yesterday also had spike and channel activity, such as the spike up to bar 2 and the channel that began with either bar 3 or bar 5. The move from bar 5 to bar 6 was another spike, as was the bar before bar 7. The channel for both began with the bar 8 low. The entire move up from bar 5 to bar 7 was probably a spike on a higher time frame chart.
>Yesterday's bull channel into the close poked above the trend channel line, which was drawn as a parallel of the bull trend line from bar 5 to bar 9. Once the market reversed back into the channel on the bar 1 2 first bar of the day, it was likely to poke through the bottom of the channel at a minimum. The next target is a measured move down using the vertical height of the channel, and the target after that is the bottom of the channel from yesterday, which was the bar 8 low. Since the move up to bar 11 had a wedge shape and the market tested below the start of the wedge, the next downside target is a measured move down. Use the height of the wedge (the bar 1 1 high minus the bar 8 low) and subtract that from the bar 8 bottom of the wedge. This target was exceeded during the sell-off below bar 17.
>Bar 1 9 was a reversal up from a second break below a bear trend channel line (drawn parallel to the bar 1 5 to bar 17 trend line), so two legs up were likely. Bar 1 8 tried to reverse up from a tiny poke below the trend channel line, but the market never went above the high of the two-bar reversal so there was no long entry.
>It is important to realize that although yesterday ended with a wedge top, there was still a strong bull trend into the close. This made beginning traders look for an additional rally on today's open, and deny the unfolding reversal. Always be ready for the opposite of what might appear likely, because it will happen in about 40 percent of the time.

##### **开盘即趋势：最高点开盘与早期做空机会**

有时，**开盘即趋势日**会在当天的最高点开盘。在图23.8中，第12根K线是当天第一根K线，它在最高点开盘，并向下突破了昨天收盘时的**楔形**。大多数交易者可能不够灵活，无法在昨天结束时的**内包K线**下方卖出，但在第一根K线收盘时小仓位卖出是合理的。如果您错过了第一次入场机会，您可以查看1分钟图寻找**小幅回调**（有很多）进行做空，或者简单地等待5分钟的**交易机会**。当出现**开盘即趋势**时，做空第一次回调是一个高概率的**交易机会**，尽管这很难执行，因为在这种情况下您是在大跌势的低点附近卖出。第15根K线是第一次回调做空的**信号K线**，它也是一次回调，并在**移动平均线**下方反转下跌。空头如此急于入场，以至于他们在**移动平均线**下方卖出，没有等待市场实际触及**移动平均线**。有些交易者可能会害怕在五根带有牛市实体的K线之后做空，但这些实体的体积很小，而且这是在强劲**熊市急涨**之后的第一次回调，因此是一个可靠的**低1做空交易机会**。它也是一次**移动平均线测试**，并与第13根K线高点形成了**双重顶熊旗**。

---

##### **急涨通道熊市与收盘反弹**

当天演变为**急涨通道熊市**，**熊市通道**始于第15根K线，也始于第17根K线，并止于第19根K线。市场在收盘前反弹，并没有收盘在最低点。

---

##### **图表深度解析：急涨与通道的反复出现**

图23.8中还有其他**急涨通道**行为，这在大多数日子里都是如此。第12根K线和其后的K线形成了一次**急涨**，第13根K线和第14根K线之前的K线也形成了一次**急涨**，并且整个跌势到第14根K线都是一次**急涨**。第15根K线后的两根K线形成了另一次**急涨**，随后是始于第17根K线**低2**并止于第19根K线的通道。

---

##### **熊市急迫性与移动平均线测试**

第16根K线也是一次**突破回调**（从跌破第14根K线和第1根K线开始）。它也足够接近跌破昨天低点，因此表现得像一次实际**突破**后的回调（接近就足够了）。空头急于做空，阻止了第一次回调触及**移动平均线**。他们担心市场可能无法到达那里，因此在接近时大量做空，导致市场从未达到**移动平均线**目标。当回调在**移动平均线**下方反转时，空头非常激进，并有一种紧迫感。他们非常渴望做空，即使价格相对较低，因此随后很可能出现更低的价格。

---

##### **通道突破与反转目标**

第19根K线是一次向上**急涨**，第20根K线**更高低点**开始了一个向上通道。第20根K线之后的K线也是一次**急涨**，在图表上最后一根K线，即第21根K线处以三K线通道结束。

昨天也有**急涨通道**活动，例如上涨到第2根K线的**急涨**，以及始于第3根或第5根K线的通道。从第5根K线到第6根K线的走势是另一次**急涨**，第7根K线之前的K线也是如此。两者的通道都始于第8根K线低点。从第5根K线到第7根K线的整个上涨走势在更高时间框架图表上可能是一次**急涨**。

昨天进入收盘时的**牛市通道**刺破了**趋势通道线**上方，这条线是作为从第5根K线到第9根K线的牛市趋势线的平行线绘制的。一旦市场在当天第12根K线第一根K线处反转回到通道内，它很可能至少会刺穿通道底部。下一个目标是使用通道垂直高度的**量度移动**下跌，而再下一个目标是昨天通道的底部，即第8根K线低点。由于上涨到第11根K线的走势呈**楔形**，并且市场测试了**楔形**起点下方，因此下一个下行目标是**量度移动**下跌。使用**楔形**的高度（第11根K线高点减去第8根K线低点），然后从第8根K线**楔形**底部减去该数值。这个目标在跌破第17根K线时被超越。

##### **趋势线突破与交易心态**

第19根K线是从**熊市趋势通道线**（绘制为与第15根K线到第17根K线趋势线的平行线）下方第二次突破后的向上反转，因此很可能出现两“腿”上涨。第18根K线试图从通道线下方的一个微小刺破后向上反转，但市场从未突破两K线反转的高点，因此没有多头入场机会。

重要的是要意识到，尽管昨天以**楔形顶**结束，但在收盘时仍然存在强劲的牛市趋势。这使得初学者在今天开盘时寻找额外的反弹，并否认正在展开的反转。永远要为可能出现的相反情况做好准备，因为它大约有40%的时间会发生。

>Not all days that begin as trend from the open days result in strong trend days in the direction of the initial trend. In Figure 23.9, the day started as a bear trend from the open. It gapped below yesterday's low but then pulled back and almost closed the gap, and bar 1 became a breakout pullback short setup. The market sold off for five bars and set up a first pullback short below bar 3, but it then entered a tight trading range instead of immediately triggering a short. Although a scalp was possible, the market reversed up in a higher low at bar 4.
>
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In Figure 23.9, bar 1 was a breakout pullback short following the breakout below yesterday's closing trading range. The initial sell-off down to bar 2 was around 12 points, which was about the average daily range recently. Once the market reversed back above the high of the open and broke to the upside, a measured move up was likely. Sometimes the market will make a measured move up equal to the open of the day to the low of the day and then close back down near the open, creating a doji day on the daily chart. Other times the measured move up is equal to about the height of the entire initial leg down. The bar 1 7 high of the day was three ticks below that measured move target. That reversal up above the opening range created a large bottom tail on the daily chart. Whenthe market turns down from about a measured move up from a large opening range, it often comes back down and the day closes somewhere in the middle of the range, as it did here.
>The spike up from bar 4 to bar 5 was also a good basis for a measured move, but it did not happen here. Instead, the market went one tick higher than a leg 1 = leg 2 move where leg 1was from bar 4 to bar 5 and leg 2 was from the bar 6 low to the bar 17 high of the day. The sell-off into the close was also a test of the bar 6 bottom of the bull channel that followed the spike up.
>The two-bar spike down from bar 1 5 was followed by a pullback to a higher high at bar 17,which was the start of the bear channel. Sometimes the pullback after the spike down can be a higher high, but when it is, there is usually another spike down after the pullback. Here, the large bear inside bar after bar 17 was a spike down, and the move down from bar 1 8 formed another spike down, with the large bear trend bars being the most influential. The three-bar move down to bar 13 was also a bear spike and therefore probably had some influence on the sell-off that eventually followed. When the market starts to form many bear trend bars, it is accumulating selling pressure, and it often is able to overwhelm the bulls eventually, as it did here.

##### **开盘趋势日的回调与反转**

并非所有以**开盘即趋势日**开始的日子都会朝着初始趋势方向发展成强劲的趋势日。在图23.9中，当天以**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势**开始。它**跳空低开**至昨天低点下方，但随后回调并几乎回补了**跳空**，第1根K线成为**突破回调做空交易机会**。市场下跌了五根K线，并在第3根K线下方形成了一个**第一次回调做空交易机会**，但随后进入了一个紧密的**交易区间**，而不是立即触发做空。尽管有可能进行**剥头皮交易**，但市场在第4根K线处以**更高低点**反转上涨。

---

##### **图表深度解析：开盘突破与量度移动**

在图23.9中，第1根K线是突破昨天收盘**交易区间**后的**突破回调做空**。初始下跌到第2根K线约为12点，这大约是最近的平均日波动范围。一旦市场反转回开盘高点上方并向上突破，很可能出现**量度移动**上涨。有时，市场会形成一个等于当天开盘价到当天低点高度的**量度移动**上涨，然后收盘时回到开盘价附近，从而在日线图上形成一个**十字星日**。其他时候，**量度移动**上涨等于整个初始下跌腿的高度。当天第17根K线的高点比那个**量度移动目标**低了三个跳动点。这次**开盘区间**上方的反转上涨在日线图上形成了一个大的下影线。当市场从大型**开盘区间**上涨的**量度移动**附近向下反转时，它通常会回落，并且当天收盘时会处于波动范围的中间，就像这里一样。

---

##### **急涨与修正：动能衰竭与卖压积聚**

从第4根K线到第5根K线的**急涨**也是**量度移动**的良好基础，但在这里没有发生。相反，市场比**第一“腿”=第二“腿”**的走势高了一个跳动点，其中第一“腿”是从第4根K线到第5根K线，第二“腿”是从第6根K线低点到第17根K线当日高点。收盘前的下跌也是对第6根K线（**急涨**后**牛市通道**底部）的测试。

从第15根K线开始的两K线**急跌**之后是到第17根K线**更高高点**的回调，这是**熊市通道**的开始。有时，**急跌**之后的回调可以是**更高高点**，但当出现这种情况时，通常在回调之后会有另一次**急跌**。在这里，第17根K线之后的大型**熊市内包K线**是一次**急跌**，从第18根K线开始的下跌形成了另一次**急跌**，其中大型**熊市趋势K线**最具影响力。下跌到第13根K线的三K线走势也是一次**熊市急跌**，因此可能对最终随后的下跌产生了一些影响。当市场开始形成许多**熊市趋势K线**时，它正在积聚卖压，它通常最终能够压倒多头，就像这里一样。

>Figure 23.10 shows a trend from the open bull trend day, but why are the best trends so difficult to trade? Because most of the with-trend entries look weak and there are many small pullbacks that trap traders out of the market. None of these pullbacks would have hit a two-point money stop, which is usually the best stop to use in a strong trend. With so many small,sideways bars, price-action stops below the lows of prior bars get hit too often and it makes more sense to rely on the original two-point stop. When the trend is strong, you need to do whatever you can do to stay long. Strong, relentless trends are often made of small bars with tails and lots of overlap but very small pullbacks that are mostly sideways pauses.
>With a large gap up on the open, the odds favored a trend day up or down, and a larger gap like this makes a bull trend more likely. Because there was no significant selling in the first several bars, there was a possibility of a bull trend from the open, so traders had to be looking long. The market moved up quietly all day because institutions had buy orders to fill, and they filled them in pieces during the day because they were afraid that a pullback might not come and they needed to buy. Their constant buying prevented a significant pullback from forming.They don't buy all at once because they might create an exhaustive buy climax and a significant reversal to well below their purchase price. Also, as the market is going up, they are receiving additional buy orders throughout the day as investors become more confident.
>
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>In a strong trend such as that shown in Figure 23.10, you can buy for any reason and at any time. Buying above pullback bars is reliable, but you can also place limit orders to buy at or below the low of the prior bar. Shorting below bars is a loser's strategy. If you were to look for shorts, you should short only above the highs of bars or at the close of strong bull trend bars.When a day is this strong, most traders should not short, because shorting would probably be a distraction and result in missing buy setups, which are swing trades in a strong trend and therefore more profitable than scalps.
>Bar 3 was the first bar of a two-bar spike up, and the market corrected sideways in a tight trading range before the channel up began. The very strongest trends tend to create reversal patterns all day long, but they somehow don't look just right. However, they constantly trap early bears into shorting, thinking that the small bars mean small risk, but after four or five small losses, they are so far behind that they will never catch up. You cannot take a trade simply because the risk is small. You need to consider the probability of success and the size of the profit target as well.
>Bears saw bars 5, 7, and 9 as a three-push pattern and therefore a wedge variant, and they then saw bars 7, 9, and 10 as another wedge. When the correction from a wedge is sideways instead of down, you should conclude that the trend is very strong; stop looking for reversals and only trade with trend.
>Bar 14 coincided with a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, and the market sold off sharply but immediately reversed up after missing the bar 5 high by one tick.Going into the close, there were several two-bar bull spikes (bars 16, 17, and 21 were the first of the two bars in each spike).
>A strong trend like this sets up reversals all day long, but the setups are never quite right and they almost always fail. The wedge that ended at bar 9 was in a tight bull channel composed almost entirely of bull trend bars. The market had not hit the moving average in over two hours. The odds were high that there would be buyers there, so there was little to be gained by shorting. Bar 1 0 broke above the trend channel line but it had a bull body. Again, the channel was very tight with no prior bear strength. You could only short a second signal and only if there was some prior bear strength, like a five- to 10-bar pullback to the moving average. In the absence of that, any short is a bet that the market would do something that it had not done all day. The biggest pullback all day was only nine ticks. If you short below a bar,your entry is about five ticks down and you need the market to go another five ticks down for you to make a one-point scalp. Since the market has tried to pull back repeatedly and could not fall more than nine ticks, betting that your short would now succeed is a very low-probability trade. You can scalp for one point and risk six or seven ticks only if the probability of success is 60 percent or higher, so you cannot short this market. You could argue that the move to bar 12 broke the bull trend line and therefore it was acceptable to short the bar 1 3higher high, but the market still had not yet pulled back to the moving average, which is just six ticks below, and there would certainly be buyers there. Also, bar 13 was the fifth consecutive bull body and that represents too much strength to be shorting.
>On most strong trend days, there is usually a sharp, brief reversal between 11:00 a.m. and noon PST that shakes out weak longs and traps overly eager bears who are hoping to recoup their earlier losses. It is always attributed to some news event, but that is irrelevant. What is important is that it usually sets up a buying opportunity for those who do not get frightened by the spike down.
>Today, there was an FOMC report at 11:15 a.m. When the report came out, bar 14 was briefly a bear trend bar with a large bear body. If you shorted before the bar closed, believing that the market was going to sell off hard on the report, you were ignoring a very important rule: you should wait for the bar to close, because what appears as a large bear trend bar at four minutes into the bar can become a doji bar or even a bull reversal bar by the time the bar closes.
>Bar 16 was a higher low after the rally from the bottom of bar 14 to the top of bar 15, and it was followed by the bar 17 breakout pullback long entry. All spikes should be thought of as spikes, climaxes, and breakouts, so the two-bar spike that began with bar 1 6 was a breakout and bar 1 7 was the entry from the pullback.
>Bar 1 9 was a double top bear flag, but there was no prior strong spike down so the market was more likely just going sideways after the bar 17 spike up.
>Bar 20 was a bull reversal bar and a high 2 long, and bar 21, the bar after the entry bar, traded below the entry bar and trapped longs out. However, since the move up from bar 20 had gone only one tick, the protective stop was below the bar 20 signal bar and you should not tighten it too soon. Strong trend days constantly trick traders into exiting longs early and into taking shorts. The bears have to buy back their shorts, which adds to the buying pressure and removes the bears from additionally shorting for at least a bar or two. They just lost and will need to recover before they look to short again. Also, the bulls who were just trapped out will chase the market as it goes up, adding to the buying.

##### **强势趋势的交易难度与应对策略**

图23.10显示了一个**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势日**，但为什么最好的趋势如此难以交易呢？因为大多数顺势入场看起来都很弱，并且有许多小幅回调会将交易者困在市场之外。这些回调都不会触及两点的**资金止损**，而这通常是强劲趋势中最好的止损方式。由于有如此多的小型横向K线，设在前K线低点下方的**价格行为止损**太容易被触发，因此更应该依赖最初的两点止损。当趋势强劲时，您需要尽一切努力保持做多。强劲、不间断的趋势通常由带有影线的小K线和大量重叠组成，但回调幅度很小，主要表现为横向暂停。

---

##### **大幅跳空高开与机构买盘**

由于**开盘时大幅跳空高开**，趋势日向上或向下的可能性很大，而像这样更大的**跳空**使牛市趋势更可能出现。由于最初几根K线没有出现显著的抛售，因此存在**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势**的可能性，因此交易者必须寻找做多机会。市场全天都在悄悄上涨，因为机构有买入订单需要填补，他们在白天分批填补，因为他们担心回调可能不会出现，而他们需要买入。他们持续的买入阻止了显著回调的形成。他们不会一次性买入所有，因为那样可能会造成**竭尽式买入高潮**和大幅反转，远低于他们的购买价格。此外，随着市场上涨，他们全天都在收到额外的买入订单，因为投资者变得更加自信。

---

##### **图表深度解析：趋势中的交易机会与陷阱**

在图23.10所示的强劲趋势中，您可以出于任何原因、在任何时间买入。在回调K线上方买入是可靠的，但您也可以设置**限价单**在当前K线低点或其下方买入。在K线下方做空是失败者的策略。如果您要寻找做空机会，您应该只在K线高点上方或强劲**牛市趋势K线**收盘时做空。当一天如此强劲时，大多数交易者不应该做空，因为做空可能会分散注意力，导致错过买入**交易机会**，而在强劲趋势中，买入**交易机会**是**波段交易**，因此比**剥头皮交易**更有利可图。

第3根K线是两K线**急涨**的第一根K线，市场在通道上涨开始之前在一个紧密的**交易区间**内横向修正。最强劲的趋势往往全天都在制造反转形态，但它们不知何故看起来就是不对劲。然而，它们不断地将早期空头困入做空，认为小K线意味着小风险，但在四五次小亏损之后，他们已经落后太多，永远无法赶上。您不能仅仅因为风险小就进行交易。您还需要考虑成功的概率和利润目标的规模。

空头将第5、7和9根K线视为**三推模式**，因此是**楔形**的一种变体，然后他们将第7、9和10根K线视为另一个**楔形**。当**楔形**的回调是横向而不是向下时，您应该得出结论，趋势非常强劲；停止寻找反转，只进行顺势交易。

第14根K线与联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）报告同时发布，市场大幅下跌但立即反转上涨，仅差一个跳动点未能触及第5根K线高点。临近收盘时，出现了几次两K线**牛市急涨**（第16、17和21根K线是每次**急涨**中的第一根K线）。

---

##### **强劲趋势中的反转失败与做空陷阱**

像这样的强劲趋势全天都在设置反转，但**交易机会**总是不太对劲，而且几乎总是失败。在第9根K线处结束的**楔形**处于一个几乎完全由**牛市趋势K线**组成的紧密**牛市通道**中。市场在两个多小时内没有触及**移动平均线**。那里出现买家的可能性很高，因此做空几乎没有收益。第10根K线突破了**趋势通道线**，但它有一个牛市实体。再次强调，通道非常紧密，没有先前的看跌强度。您只能做空第二个信号，并且只有在有先前的看跌强度时，例如五到十根K线回调到**移动平均线**。如果没有，任何做空都是一种赌注，赌市场会做一些全天都没有做过的事情。全天最大回调只有九个跳动点。如果您在K线下方做空，您的入场大约向下五个跳动点，您需要市场再向下五个跳动点才能赚取一点的**剥头皮利润**。由于市场多次尝试回调，但未能跌破九个跳动点，因此赌您的做空会成功是一种非常低概率的交易。只有当成功的概率达到60%或更高时，您才能以一跳动点的利润并冒六七个跳动点的风险进行**剥头皮交易**，因此您不能做空这个市场。您可以争辩说，到第12根K线的走势突破了**牛市趋势线**，因此做空第13根K线**更高高点**是可以接受的，但市场仍然没有回调到**移动平均线**，它只在下方六个跳动点，那里肯定会有买家。此外，第13根K线是连续第五根牛市实体，这代表了太强的力量，不适合做空。

---

##### **盘中反转与FOMC报告影响**

在大多数强劲趋势日，通常在太平洋时间上午11:00到中午之间会出现一次剧烈而短暂的反转，这会震出弱势多头，并困住过于急切希望弥补早期损失的空头。这总是归因于某个新闻事件，但这无关紧要。重要的是，它通常为那些不被**急跌**吓倒的人提供了买入**交易机会**。

今天，太平洋时间上午11:15发布了FOMC报告。报告发布时，第14根K线短暂地成为一根带有大熊市实体的**熊市趋势K线**。如果您在K线收盘前做空，相信市场会因报告而大幅抛售，那么您就忽略了一个非常重要的规则：您应该等待K线收盘，因为在K线开始四分钟时看起来像一根大型**熊市趋势K线**，到K线收盘时可能会变成**十字星K线**甚至**牛市反转K线**。

---

##### **突破回调与止损策略**

第16根K线是在从第14根K线底部到第15根K线顶部反弹之后的**更高低点**，随后是第17根K线**突破回调做多入场**。所有的**急涨**都应该被视为**急涨**、**高潮**和**突破**，因此从第16根K线开始的两K线**急涨**是一次**突破**，第17根K线是回调的入场点。

第19根K线是一个**双重顶熊旗**，但之前没有强劲的**急跌**，因此市场在第17根K线**急涨**之后更可能只是横向盘整。

第20根K线是**牛市反转K线**和**高2做多**，第21根K线，即入场K线之后的K线，交易在入场K线下方，困住了多头。然而，由于从第20根K线开始的上涨只走了一个跳动点，**保护性止损**位于第20根**信号K线**下方，您不应该过早地收紧止损。强劲的趋势日不断地诱骗交易者过早地退出多头头寸并进行做空。空头必须回补空头头寸，这增加了买盘压力，并使空头至少在一两根K线内无法进一步做空。他们刚刚亏损，需要恢复才能再次做空。此外，刚刚被困住的多头会追涨，从而增加买盘。

>A trend from the open can have a double top or bottom before the strong trend begins. In Figure 23.11, bar 7 tried to set up a bear trend from the open but the high was tested on a 7:00a.m. report, which commonly happens. Even though the market formed a small trading range up to bar 9, you always have to consider the possibility that the market was just waiting for the report before it unleashed its strength.
>The opening range was less than a third of the size of the range of recent days, and this put the market in breakout mode. Once there was a spike down and a spike up after the first bar (a reversal down and then a reversal up), some traders would enter on a breakout, expecting the range to increase severalfold. After the market fell below the bar 7 two-bar reversal, the bar 7reversal down became a swing high. After the market moved above bar 8, bar 8 became a swing low and a reversal up. These traders placed a buy stop at one tick above the bar 7 spike top and a sell stop at one tick below the bar 8 spike bottom. Once the buy order got filled as bar 9 moved above the high of bar 7, they doubled the size of the sell stop below bar 8. As that second order got filled, as it did in the move below bar 8, they got stopped out of their longs and they reversed into shorts. This is the traditional approach to this setup, but it is generally better to be more aggressive. A better approachwould have been for traders to short below the bar 7 two-bar reversal and scalp out part, and then tighten their protective stops. Next, they could reverse to long on the bar 8 high 2 at the moving average. They could scalp out part and tighten their stops. They could reverse to short below the bar 9 outside down bear bar, since there were trapped bull breakout traders and the market was forming a double top bear flag with bar 7. They could scalp out part, tighten their stops, and swing the balance until there was a clear buy signal; if there was none, they could hold short into the close. If they did buy at maybe the bar 15,18, or 21 lows, they had to reverse to short as they took profits. If they were unable to do that, they should either continue to hold short or exit on those minor buy signals and look to short rallies.
>Even though the day began with a small trading range and some traders might call this a trending trading range day or a bear trend resumption day, when the pullbacks are this small,you are dealing with a very strong bear trend. When that is the case, it is better to make sure that you are short for most or all of the day. Thinking of this as a trending trading range day will make you take longs and often miss shorts. The pullback that began at bar 15 was about twice the size of the earlier pullbacks since the trend began at bar 9. The day was not a classic small pullback trend day because those days usually don't have a larger pullback until later in the day, like after 11:00 a.m. PST, but today was still a strong bear trend day.
>
>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>Bars 11, 13, and 15 formed a wedge in Figure 23.11, but since the market had not touched the moving average in about 20 bars and the bear channel was tight, this would likely lead to a test of the moving average where bears would short aggressively. The bulls were able to generate two legs up to bar 17, which was a moving average gap bar. The first moving average gap bar in a bear trend often leads to the final leg down before there is a larger correction up.
>Since the leg up to the moving average gap bar almost always breaks a significant bear trend line, the higher low or lower low test of the bear low usually leads to a protracted correction up or even a reversal. The market tried to reverse up at bar 18 and again at the small wedge that ended at bar 21. The market created a strong two-bar bull spike up to bar 22, trapping bulls in and bears out, but experienced traders know that the market often has a strong countertrend move after 11 a.m. PST on a trend day and they would be ready to short the failure, like the small double top at bar 24. There was a bear inside bar for the signal bar and the bar 22 and 24 double top formed a larger double top bear flag with bar 17. The spike down to bar 25 was followed by a couple of strong bull trend bars, which set up the bar 26 breakout pullback short for the sell-off into the close. That reversal attempt at bar 25 was the signal bar for an expanding triangle bottom, where bars 18, 21, and 25 were the three lows. Instead, the bottom failed and bar 26 became the breakout pullback short entry bar. A failed wedge often leads to a measured move down, and the sell-off into the close came close to the target.
>This turned the day into a trend resumption bear, where there was an initial bear trend down to bar 13, then a trading range that lasted a couple of hours to bar 24, and then another bear leg into the close.

##### **开盘趋势的特点与初期交易策略**

**开盘即趋势**的走势在强劲趋势开始之前可能会出现**双重顶**或**双重底**。在图23.11中，第7根K线试图形成**开盘即趋势的熊市趋势**，但高点在上午7:00的报告中被测试，这种情况很常见。尽管市场直到第9根K线才形成一个**小交易区间**，但您始终必须考虑市场只是在等待报告发布，然后才会释放其力量的可能性。

---

##### **开盘区间与突破模式**

**开盘区间**小于最近几天波动范围的三分之一，这使得市场处于**突破模式**。一旦第一根K线之后出现一次向下**急跌**和一次向上**急涨**（先是向下反转，然后是向上反转），一些交易者会**突破**入场，预期波动范围会扩大好几倍。在市场跌破第7根K线**两K线反转**后，第7根K线向下反转成为一个**摆动高点**。在市场突破第8根K线后，第8根K线成为一个**摆动低点**和向上反转。这些交易者在第7根K线**急涨顶**上方一个跳动点设置买入止损单，并在第8根K线**急涨底**下方一个跳动点设置卖出止损单。一旦买入订单在第9根K线突破第7根K线高点时成交，他们将第8根K线下方卖出止损单的规模加倍。当第二个订单成交时（就像跌破第8根K线时那样），他们的多头头寸被止损，并反转为做空。这是这种**交易机会**的传统方法，但通常更激进会更好。

---

##### **更激进的交易方法与止损策略**

一个更好的方法是交易者在第7根K线**两K线反转**下方做空，并**剥头皮**一部分，然后收紧**保护性止损**。接下来，他们可以在**移动平均线**处第8根K线**高2**反转做多。他们可以**剥头皮**一部分并收紧止损。他们可以在第9根**外包下跌熊市K线**下方反转做空，因为有被困的牛市**突破交易者**，并且市场正在与第7根K线形成**双重顶熊旗**。他们可以**剥头皮**一部分，收紧止损，并**波段交易**剩余部分，直到出现明确的买入信号；如果没有，他们可以持有空头到收盘。如果他们在第15、18或21根K线低点处买入，他们必须在获利了结时反转做空。如果他们无法做到这一点，他们应该继续持有空头，或者在那些次要买入信号处退出并寻找做空反弹的机会。

---

##### **强劲熊市趋势的判断**

尽管当天以**小交易区间**开始，有些交易者可能会称之为**趋势性交易区间日**或**熊市趋势恢复日**，但当回调幅度如此之小时，您正在处理一个非常强劲的熊市趋势。在这种情况下，最好确保您在当天大部分或全部时间都处于做空状态。将此视为**趋势性交易区间日**会使您进行多头交易，并经常错过做空机会。从第15根K线开始的回调大约是趋势从第9根K线开始后的早期回调的两倍。当天不是经典的**小幅回调趋势日**，因为那些日子通常直到当天晚些时候（例如太平洋时间上午11:00之后）才会有更大的回调，但今天仍然是一个强劲的熊市趋势日。

---

##### **图表深度解析：楔形与移动平均线测试**

图23.11中，第11、13和15根K线形成了**楔形**，但由于市场在约20根K线内没有触及**移动平均线**，并且**熊市通道**紧密，这很可能会导致对**移动平均线**的测试，空头会积极做空。多头能够产生两“腿”上涨到第17根K线，这是一根**移动平均线跳空K线**。熊市趋势中的第一根**移动平均线跳空K线**通常会导致在出现更大修正上涨之前的最后一“腿”下跌。

---

##### **反向走势与失败的底部形态**

由于上涨到**移动平均线跳空K线**的那一“腿”几乎总是突破重要的**熊市趋势线**，因此**更高低点**或**更低低点**对熊市低点的测试通常会导致长期修正上涨甚至反转。市场在第18根K线处尝试向上反转，并在第21根K线处结束的小**楔形**再次尝试。市场创造了一个强劲的两K线**牛市急涨**到第22根K线，困住了多头，并使空头无法入场，但经验丰富的交易者知道市场在趋势日太平洋时间上午11点后经常出现强劲的**逆势移动**，他们会准备好做空失败，例如第24根K线处的小型**双重顶**。**信号K线**是**熊市内包K线**，第22和24根K线**双重顶**与第17根K线形成了更大的**双重顶熊旗**。下跌到第25根K线的**急跌**之后是几根强劲的**牛市趋势K线**，这为收盘前的下跌设置了第26根K线**突破回调做空**。第25根K线处的反转尝试是**扩张三角形底**的**信号K线**，其中第18、21和25根K线是三个低点。相反，底部失败，第26根K线成为**突破回调做空**入场K线。失败的**楔形**通常会导致**量度移动**下跌，收盘前的下跌接近目标。

---

##### **趋势恢复与日内形态演变**

这使得当天变成了**趋势恢复熊市**，其中最初的熊市趋势下跌到第13根K线，然后是一个持续了几个小时到第24根K线的**交易区间**，然后是另一“腿”熊市走势到收盘。

---
