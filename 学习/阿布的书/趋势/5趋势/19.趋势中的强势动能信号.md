>There are many characteristics of strong trends. The most obvious one is that they run from one corner of your chart to the diagonally opposite corner with only small pullbacks.However, in the early stages of a trend, there are signs that indicate that the move is strong and likely to last. The more of these signs that are present, the more you should focus on with-trend entries. You should start to look at countertrend setups only as great with-trend setups,with you entering on a stop exactly where those countertrend traders will be forced to exit with a loss.

##### 强势趋势的特征与交易重点

强势趋势有许多特征。最明显的一点是，它们从图表的一个角落运行到对角线相反的角落，期间只有小幅回调。然而，在趋势的早期阶段，有一些迹象表明这一走势强劲且可能持续。存在的这些迹象越多，您就应该越专注于**顺势入场**。

#重点 #策略 #反转 
您应该只将**逆势交易机会**视为绝佳的**顺势交易机会**，并且您入场的止损点恰好是那些逆势交易者将被迫亏损出场的点位。
*将**逆势交易机会**视为绝佳的**顺势交易机会**，并且入场的止损点恰好是那些逆势交易者将被迫亏损出场的点位。*

>One interesting phenomenon in trend days is that on many of the days, the best reversal bars and the biggest trend bars tend to be countertrend, trapping traders into the wrong direction.Also, the lack of great with-trend signal bars makes traders question their entries, forcing them to chase the market and enter late.
##### 趋势日中的反常现象与交易者陷阱
#陷阱 #重点 #反直觉
在趋势日中，一个有趣的现象是，许多日子里，**最好的反转K线和最大的趋势K线往往是逆势的**，这会将交易者引入错误的方向。

此外，**缺乏好的顺势信号K线**会使交易者质疑他们的入场，迫使他们追涨杀跌，从而导致入场过晚。
*如果一个交易机会越明显，那么它的潜在收益越小*
*最好的反转K线和最大的趋势K线往往是逆势的*

>Finally, once you realize that the market is in a strong trend, you don't need a setup to enter.You can enter anytime all day long at the market if you wish with a relatively small stop. The only purpose of a setup is to minimize the risk. Here are some characteristics that are commonly found in strong trends:
>• There is a big gap opening on the day.
>• There are trending highs and lows (swings).
>• Most of the bars are trend bars in the direction of the trend.
>• There is very little overlap of the bodies of consecutive bars. For example, in a bull spike,many bars have lows that are at or just one tick below the closes of the prior bar. Some bars have lows that are at and not below the close of the prior bar, so traders trying to buy on a limit order at the close of the prior bar do not get their orders filled and they have to buy higher.
>• There are bars with no tails or small tails in either direction, indicating urgency. For example, in a bull trend, if a bull trend bar opens on its low tick and trends up, traders were eager to buy it as soon as the prior bar closed. If it closes on or near its high tick, traders continued their strong buying in anticipation of new buyers entering right after the bar closes.They were willing to buy going into the close because they were afraid that if they waited for the bar to close, they might have to buy a tick or two higher.
>• Occasionally, there are gaps between the bodies (for example, the open of a bar might be above the close of the prior bar in a bull trend).• A breakout gap appears in the form of a strong trend bar at the start of the trend (a trend bar is a type of gap, as discussed in book 2).
>• Measuring gaps occur where the breakout test does not overlap the breakout point. For example, the pullback from a bull breakout does not drop below the high of the bar where the breakout occurred.
>• Micro measuring gaps appear where there is a strong trend bar and a gap between the bar before it and the bar after it. For example, if the low of the bar after a strong bull trend bar in a bull trend is at or above the high of the bar before the trend bar, this is a gap and a breakout test and a sign of strength.
>• No big climaxes appear.
>• Not many large bars appear (not even large trend bars). Often, the largest trend bars are countertrend, trapping traders into looking for countertrend trades and missing with-trend trades. The countertrend setups almost always look better than the with-trend setups.
>• No significant trend channel line overshoots occur, and the minor ones result in only sideways corrections.
>• The corrections after trend line breaks go sideways instead of countertrend.
>• Failed wedges and other failed reversals occur.
>• There is a sequence of 20 moving average gap bars (20 or more consecutive bars that do not touch the moving average, discussed in book 2).
>• Few if any profitable countertrend trades are found.
>• There are small, infrequent, and mostly sideways pullbacks. For example, if the Emini'saverage range is 12 points, the pullbacks will all likely be less than three or four points, and the market will often go for five or more bars without a pullback.
>• There is a sense of urgency. You find yourself waiting through countless bars for a good with-trend pullback and one never comes, yet the market slowly continues to trend.
>• The pullbacks have strong setups. For example, the high 1 and high 2 pullbacks in a bull trend have strong bull reversal bars for signal bars.
>• In the strongest trends, the pullbacks usually have weak signal bars, making many traders not take them, and forcing traders to chase the market. Forexample, in a bear trend the signal bars for a low 2 short are often small bull bars in two or three bar bull spikes, and some of the entry bars are outside down bars. It has trending "anything": closes, highs, lows, or bodies.
>• Repeated two-legged pullbacks are setting up with trend entries.
>• No two consecutive trend bar closes occur on the opposite side of the moving average.
>• The trend goes very far and breaks several resistance levels, like the moving average, prior swing highs, and trend lines, and each by many ticks.
>• Reversal attempts in the form of spikes against the trend have no follow-through, fail, and become flags in the direction of the trend.
##### 强势趋势的识别与交易机会

最后，一旦您意识到市场处于强势趋势中，您就不再需要一个“交易机会”才能入场了。如果您愿意，可以全天随时市价入场，并使用相对较小的止损。**“交易机会”的唯一目的是最小化风险。**
#心法 
*“交易机会”的唯一目的是最小化风险。*

以下是强势趋势中常见的特征：

- **大跳空开盘**：当天出现巨大的跳空开盘。
- **趋势性高点和低点（摆动）**：市场不断创出趋势性的高点和低点。
- **多数K线为趋势K线**：绝大多数K线都是顺应趋势方向的趋势K线。
- **连续K线实体重叠极少**：例如，在牛市急涨中，许多K线的低点都在前一根K线收盘价处或仅低一个跳动点。有些K线的低点甚至在前一根K线收盘价处而不低于它，这使得试图在限价单在前一根K线收盘价处买入的交易者无法成交，不得不以更高的价格买入。
- **无影线或影线很小**：K线在任一方向上都没有影线或影线很小，这表明市场的紧迫性。例如，在牛市趋势中，如果一根看涨趋势K线以其最低价开盘并向上运行，交易者会迫不及待地在前一根K线收盘后立即买入。如果它以其最高价或接近最高价收盘，交易者会继续强劲买入，预期在K线收盘后立即有新的买家入场。他们愿意在收盘前买入，因为他们担心如果等到K线收盘，可能不得不以一两个跳动点更高的价格买入。
- **偶尔出现实体之间的跳空**：例如，在牛市趋势中，一根K线的开盘价可能高于前一根K线的收盘价。
- **趋势开始时出现突破性跳空**：以强劲趋势K线的形式出现（趋势K线是一种跳空，在第二本书中讨论）。
- **量度性跳空**：突破测试与突破点不重叠。例如，看涨突破后的回调没有跌破突破发生K线的高点。
- **微型量度性跳空**：当出现强劲趋势K线，并且它前后的K线之间存在跳空时。例如，在牛市趋势中，如果一根强劲看涨趋势K线之后的那根K线的低点在其之前那根K线的高点处或上方，这是一种跳空，也是突破测试和强势的标志。
- **没有出现大的高潮**。
- **没有出现太多大型K线**：甚至没有大型趋势K线。通常，最大的趋势K线是逆势的，这会诱使交易者寻找逆势交易而错过顺势交易。“逆势交易机会”几乎总是看起来比“顺势交易机会”更好。*通常，最大的趋势K线是逆势的：陷阱*
- **没有出现明显的趋势通道线超调**：即使是次要的超调也只会导致横盘修正。
- **趋势线突破后的修正以横盘为主**：而不是逆势修正。
- **失败的楔形和其他失败的反转**：经常发生。
- **连续20根移动平均线缺口K线**：有20根或更多连续的K线没有触及移动平均线（在第二本书中讨论）。
- **很少或没有盈利的逆势交易**。
- **回调小、不频繁且大多横盘**：例如，如果E-mini的平均波动范围是12点，那么回调很可能都小于三或四点，而且市场通常会连续五根或更多K线没有回调。
- **存在紧迫感**：您会发现自己等待无数根K线以等待一个好的顺势回调，但它从未到来，然而市场却缓慢地持续趋势。
- **回调具有强劲的“交易机会”**：例如，牛市趋势中的高1和高2回调具有强劲的看涨反转K线作为信号K线。
- **在最强的趋势中，回调通常具有弱势信号K线**：这使得许多交易者不愿入场，并迫使交易者追涨杀跌。例如，在熊市趋势中，低2做空信号K线通常是两三根K线看涨急涨中的小型看涨K线，并且一些入场K线是外包向下K线。*陷阱：回调中的弱信号k（可以使更多想入场的人观望，他们的情绪会越来越焦灼）*
- **具有趋势性的一切**：收盘价、高点、低点或实体都呈现趋势性。
- **重复的两段式回调形成顺势入场机会**。
- **没有连续两根趋势K线收盘在移动平均线的另一侧**。
- **趋势发展非常远并突破多个阻力位**：如移动平均线、前期摆动高点和趋势线，且每个突破都超过很多跳动点。
- **逆势的急涨反转尝试没有跟进动量，失败后转变为顺势的旗形**。


>When a trend is in runaway mode, there will likely be no pullbacks for many bars and the bars will be good-sized trend bars with mostly small tails. Since you want to keep scalping more as the trend continues while still holding on to the swing portion of your position, you might consider looking at the 3 minute chart for additional with-trend setups. It often has more pause bars (countertrend inside bars and one-bar pullbacks) that allow for with-trend entries.The 1 minute chart also has with-trend entries but in addition it has some countertrend setups, which can be confusing when you are trying to trade only with trend. This, along with the speed of the reading required, can create too much stress during a runaway trend and can interfere with your ability to trade effectively. Since you need to be making sure that you catch every with-trend entry, it is best to trade only off the 5 minute chart in a runaway trend. Once you become experienced and successful, you might consider also looking at the 3 minute chart.

##### 奔跑式趋势中的交易策略
#技巧
当趋势处于**奔跑模式（runaway mode）** 时，很可能在许多K线内都不会有回调，并且K线会是实体较大且影线多为小型的趋势K线。

由于您希望在趋势持续时继续进行更多的**剥头皮交易**，同时仍持有仓位的**波段部分**，您可以考虑查看3分钟图表以寻找额外的**顺势交易机会**。它通常会有更多的暂停K线（逆势内包K线和单K线回调），这允许进行顺势入场。

##### 图表选择与交易效率

1分钟图表也提供顺势入场机会，但它还包含一些逆势**交易机会**，当您试图只进行顺势交易时，这可能会造成混淆。这，再加上所需的阅读速度，可能会在奔跑式趋势中产生过大的压力，并干扰您有效交易的能力。

>Over time, the trend weakens; more signs of two-sided trading develop and the signs of strength begin to disappear. For example, in a bull trend traders begin to take profits above the highs of the prior bars and above swing highs, and aggressive bears begin to short above the highs of bars and above swing highs and will scale in higher. The strong bulls will eventually only buy pullbacks. The initial bull spike is replaced by a bull channel, and it eventually evolves into a trading range.
##### 趋势的演变与交易策略的调整

随着时间的推移，趋势会逐渐减弱；双向交易的迹象会越来越多，而强势的迹象则开始消失。

例如，在牛市趋势中，交易者开始在前期K线高点上方和摆动高点上方获利了结，而激进的空头则开始在K线高点上方和摆动高点上方做空，并会**分批在更高点加仓**。强势的多头最终将只会买入回调。

最初的牛市**急涨**会被**牛市通道**取代，并最终演变为一个**交易区间**。

>Large gaps that don't reverse early usually mark the start of a strong trend for the day and the day often closes at or near the high (or low, in a bear). As shown in Figure 19.1, the 5 minute Emini gapped up 11 points, which is huge, and the first bar was a bull trend bar. Also, the market did not test the moving average for over two hours, another sign of strength. Notice how there was not much emotional behavior (big bars, climaxes, big swings). Quiet markets with lots of small bars, many of which are dojis, often lead to the biggest trends.
##### 大幅跳空与强劲趋势的开端
#模式
大幅跳空开盘且没有在早期反转的市场，通常标志着当天强劲趋势的开始，并且当天收盘时通常会接近高点（或在熊市中接近低点）。

如图19.1所示，Emini股指期货跳空高开11点，这是一个巨大的跳空，并且第一根K线是一根看涨趋势K线。此外，市场在超过两个小时内都没有测试移动平均线，这是另一个强势信号。
##### 市场情绪与趋势强度

请注意，市场中并没有太多情绪化的行为（如大K线、高潮、大摆动）。平静的市场，伴随着许多小型K线，其中许多是十字星，往往会带来最大的趋势。

![[Pasted image 20250707125943.png]]


>On days like this, the institutions have a huge amount to buy and they want lower prices, but when the lower prices don't come, they have to fill their orders in pieces all day long, at increasingly higher prices. Even though they see the trendday unfolding and expect that they will likely have to be buying at higher prices throughout the day, they don't dump all of their buy orders onto the market at once, because this could cause a climactic spike up and then possibly a reversal down below their average entry price.They are content filling their orders in manageable pieces all day long, understanding that they are buying higher and higher, but knowing that the market will likely go higher still. Also,strong days like this usually have higher prices over the next one to several days.
##### 机构在趋势日中的交易行为

在像这样的趋势日，机构有大量的买入需求，他们希望以更低的价格成交。但当更低的价格不出现时，他们不得不**全天分批买入**，且价格越来越高。

尽管他们看到趋势日正在展开，并预期当天很可能必须以更高的价格买入，但他们并不会一次性将所有买单全部投入市场，因为这可能导致**高潮式的急涨**，随后可能反转跌破他们的平均入场价格。

##### 机构的耐心与市场预期
#心法 #技巧 #策略
他们满足于**全天以可控的碎片化方式完成订单**，理解他们正在以越来越高的价格买入，但也知道市场很可能会继续走高。此外，像这样的强势日子，通常在接下来的一到几天内也会有更高的价格。
*强势趋势日，由于机构有很多订单要买，当日不会出现急涨，因为急涨很容易反转跌破他们的平均入场价*
*并且由于机构的成本在这儿，所以随后的几天，还会有更高的价格出现*

>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The market broke out above yesterday's high in Figure 19.1, but the breakout became a failed breakout when the market turned down below the bear inside bar that followed the bar 2strong bull spike. Big gap up days often test the low of the open and form a small double bottom bull flag. When the opening range is small like this, that market is in breakout mode and traders will enter in the direction of the breakout. On a big gap up day, the odds favor an upside breakout. Aggressive bulls could enter above bar 3, based on the double bottom, but many bulls entered on a stop above the bar 2 high of the opening range. The day was a trend from the open bull trend day and a trend resumption bull day.The market had a small two-legged move down to bar 3. A bear trend bar and two dojiscomposed the first leg. The second leg was made up of a bear trend bar with a large bear tail on top (the tail was the pullback that ended the first leg down) followed by a doji. This variant of a two-legged move would certainly have two clear legs down on a smaller time frame chart,setting up an ABC buy signal. A trader could buy at one tick above bar 3. It was also a test of the gap, forming a double bottom with the low of bar 1. Since this was a possible trend day and as such could extend much further than most traders would ever suspect, smart traders would swing part or all of their positions. Note how the open of the day was very close to the low of the day, which is a sign of strength, and trend from the open days that open within a few ticks of the low of the day often close within a few ticks of the high of the day, and there is often a trend into the close.
>Bar 5 was a high 1 breakout pullback after a strong move up (four bull trend bars), and a high 1 is always a good buy in the spike phase of a strong bull trend. The bar 4 low 1 break below the trend line and reversal from the new high was not a short, even for a scalp. In fact, it is incorrect to use the term low 1 here because a low 1 sets up trades in trading ranges and bear trends, not strong bull trends. After such a strong up move, smart traders would only be looking to buy and would consider a short only if there was a second entry.
>Bar 6 was a low 2, which was a second entry short and a possible top of a trading range within a bull trend. However, in the face of the strong bull trend, shorts would only scalp this trade.They would swing it only if there was first a prior strong down move that broke a substantial trend line (maybe 20 or more bars). If they shorted, they would be quick to exit and then they would look for a long setup for a swing trade. With-trend entries in a strong trend should be mostly swung, with only a small potion taken off as a scalp. If you find thatyou missed awith-trend entry, stop looking for countertrend scalps and start trading only with-trend setups.During a trend day, you must try to catch every with-trend signal, because that is the source of the most consistent money.
>Since the bar 6 entry bar was a strong bear trend bar, it is a breakout and therefore a spike.Spikes are usually followed by channels with at least two more pushes; but when they occur against a strong trend, they often just have one more push and become a two-legged bull flag.In any case, after a spike down, there was a good chance for at least one more leg down.
>Bar 7 was an entry bar for a low 2 short into the second leg down, but after a six-bar tight trading range, any breakout in either direction would likely fail after not going very far.
>Bar 8 was a two-legged pullback and the first to the moving average in a strong bull trend,which is a great buy. Whenever the market stays away from the moving average for 20 bars or more (a 20 gap bar buy setup), the trend is very strong and the odds are high that there will be buyers at the moving average.
>Bar 9 was a reversal at a new swing high, but there were no bear trend bars among the prior seven bars so no short could be taken unless a second entry forms.
>Bar 10 was a second entry, but in a tight trading range in a bull trend, any short is a scalp at best and it is probably best to pass on this trade. Sideways price action in a bull trend is usually a bull flag and will usually break out in the direction of the trend that was in effect before it formed. Outside bars are less reliable, but you could consider taking the short for a scalp since second entries are so reliable. Three small dojis developed at the moving average.This was a small tight trading range and therefore had a magnetic effect. The odds were high that there would be a trend bar breakout in either direction and it would fail. Traders held short and risked maybe four ticks. The bar 11 bull trend bar breakout failed, as expected,allowing traders to take a four-tick scalp profit on the next bar.
>Bar 13 was a breakout test that extended one tick below the high of the signal bar that generated the strong move up from the bar 8 long. The move down from bars 9 to 13 was very weak and appeared essentially sideways. The market struggled to get down to test the breakout, meaning the bears lacked conviction. Bar 13 also set up a high 4 entry just below the moving average, and it followed the first moving average gap bar of the day (a bar with a high below the exponential moving average). This was a moving average gap bar setup in a strong trend and should be expected to test the high of the bull trend with either a lower high or a higher high. A moving average gap bar in a strong trend often leads to the final leg of the trend before a deeper, longer-lasting pullback develops, and the pullback can grow and become a trend reversal. This might have happened on the following day. Bar 13 formed a higher low (higher than bar 8) following a higher high at bar 9, and is part of trending bull swings. It is essentially a double bottom bull flag with bar 8.
>Bar 14 was a high 2 breakout signal bar, and the high 1 was the prior bar.
>Bar 15 was a signal bar for a final flag short but the market never triggered the entry because it did not trade below the signal bar low. However, as a bear bar, it was a small leg down. The next bar was a bull trend bar and then there was another bear trend bar. This second bear trend bar was a small second leg down and therefore was a high 2 buy setup.
>Bar 17 was the first breakout of a bull micro channel on a strong bull day, and therefore it was a setup for a buy at one tick above its high. The channel had a wedge shape and, although traders would not short here, the theoretical protective buy stop for shorts is one tick above the high of the wedge. There was a large bull trend bar that ran through those buy stops,showing a strong rejection of the bear case. The bar was so strong because there were bulls who expected the bar 17 short to fail and therefore placed buy stops above its high to get long,and there were the bears who got stopped out at one tick above the bar 16 top of the wedge.
>Bar 18 broke above a bull trend channel line and gave a low 2 short signal. However, on a strong trend day, smart traders will short only if there is first a strong bear leg that broke a trend line. Otherwise, they would view all short setups as buy setups, and place orders to go long exactly where the weak shorts would have to cover (like one tick above the highs of bars 17 and 19).
>Bar 19 was a one-bar trend line break that failed, and therefore a buy setup. There was a two-bar bull reversal that became the signal for the long.

##### 图表深度解读：以图19.1为例

图19.1中，市场突破了昨日高点，但当市场跌破第2根强劲看涨急涨K线之后的那根看跌内包K线时，这次突破演变为**失败突破**。大幅跳空高开的日子通常会测试开盘价的低点并形成一个小型**双重底牛旗**。当开盘区间如此狭窄时，市场处于突破模式，交易者将顺着突破方向入场。在大幅跳空高开的日子里，上行突破的概率更大。激进的多头可以在第3根K线上方入场，基于双重底，但许多多头在开盘区间第2根K线高点上方设置止损买单入场。当天是一个**开盘即趋势的牛市趋势日**，也是一个**趋势恢复牛市日**。

市场到第3根K线有一个小幅的两段式下跌。第一段由一根看跌趋势K线和两根十字星K线组成。第二段由一根顶部带有大看跌影线（影线是结束第一段下跌的回调）的看跌趋势K线，随后是一根十字星K线组成。这种两段式下跌的变体在更小的时间框架图表上肯定会有清晰的两段下跌，形成一个**ABC买入信号**。交易者可以在第3根K线上方一个跳动点买入。它也是对跳空的测试，与第1根K线的低点形成了**双重底**。

由于这可能是一个趋势日，并且因此可能比大多数交易者预期的延伸更远，聪明的交易者会**波段持有**部分或全部头寸。请注意当天开盘价非常接近当天低点，这是一个强劲的标志，而开盘价在当天低点几个跳动点内的“开盘即趋势”日通常会收盘在当天高点几个跳动点内，并且通常会有一个**趋势直到收盘**。

---

##### 强势趋势中的入场与反转信号解读

第5根K线是强劲上涨（四根看涨趋势K线）后的**高1突破回调**，在强劲牛市趋势的急涨阶段，高1始终是一个很好的买入机会。第4根K线**低1跌破趋势线**以及新高后的反转不是做空机会，即使是剥头皮交易也不行。事实上，这里使用“低1”这个词是不正确的，因为低1是在**交易区间**和熊市趋势中设置交易，而不是强劲牛市趋势。在如此强劲的上涨之后，聪明的交易者只会寻找买入机会，只有在出现第二次入场机会时才会考虑做空。

第6根K线是**低2**，这是第二次做空入场机会，也是牛市趋势中**交易区间**的可能顶部。然而，面对强劲的牛市趋势，做空者只会剥头皮交易这笔。他们只有在之前出现强劲下跌并突破重要趋势线（可能20根或更多K线）的情况下才会波段持有。如果他们做空，他们会迅速平仓，然后寻找做多**交易机会**进行波段交易。强劲趋势中的顺势入场应该大部分是波段持有，只有小部分作为剥头皮了结。如果您发现自己错过了顺势入场，请停止寻找逆势剥头皮机会，并开始只交易顺势“交易机会”。在趋势日中，您必须尝试抓住每一个顺势信号，因为那是持续盈利的主要来源。

---

##### K线形态与市场行为分析

由于第6根入场K线是强劲的看跌趋势K线，它是一个突破，因此是一个**急涨**。急涨通常伴随着至少两次以上推动的通道；但当它们发生在强劲趋势的逆势方向时，它们通常只有一次推动并演变为两段式牛旗。无论如何，在急跌之后，很可能至少还有一次下跌。

第7根K线是**低2做空入场K线**，进入第二段下跌，但经过六K线紧密**交易区间**后，任何方向的突破在没有走得很远之后都可能失败。

第8根K线是**两段式回调**，也是强劲牛市趋势中第一次触及移动平均线，这是一个很好的买入机会。无论何时，当市场远离移动平均线20根K线或更多（**20缺口K线买入交易机会**）时，趋势都非常强劲，买家在移动平均线处出现的可能性很高。

第9根K线是新摆动高点处的反转，但在之前七根K线中没有看跌趋势K线，所以除非出现第二次入场机会，否则不能做空。

第10根K线是第二次入场，但在牛市趋势中的紧密**交易区间**内，任何做空充其量也只是剥头皮，最好还是放弃这笔交易。牛市趋势中的横盘走势通常是牛旗，并且通常会向其形成之前的趋势方向突破。外包K线可靠性较低，但您可以考虑剥头皮做空，因为第二次入场机会非常可靠。在移动平均线处形成了三根小型十字星K线。这是一个小型紧密**交易区间**，因此具有磁性效应。任何方向的趋势K线突破都有很高的失败概率。交易者持有空头，风险可能约为四个跳动点。第11根看涨趋势K线突破失败，正如预期，使得交易者在下一根K线上获得四个跳动点的剥头皮利润。

---

##### 移动平均线缺口与趋势后期

第13根K线是一个**突破测试**，它延伸到生成第8根K线做多强劲上涨的信号K线高点下方一个跳动点。从第9到第13根K线的下跌走势非常弱，基本上呈横盘状态。市场努力下跌以测试突破，这意味着空头缺乏信心。第13根K线还在移动平均线下方设置了一个**高4入场机会**，并且它紧随当天第一根移动平均线缺口K线（高点低于指数移动平均线的K线）。这是一个强劲趋势中的**移动平均线缺口K线“交易机会”**，预计它将测试牛市趋势的高点，无论是更低的高点还是更高的高点。强劲趋势中的**移动平均线缺口K线**通常会导致趋势的最后一段，之后会形成更深、更持久的回调，并且回调可能会扩大并成为趋势反转。这可能发生在第二天。第13根K线在第9根K线形成更高高点后形成了一个更高低点（高于第8根K线），并且是趋势性牛市摆动的一部分。它本质上是一个与第8根K线形成的**双重底牛旗**。

第14根K线是**高2突破信号K线**，高1是前一根K线。

第15根K线是**最终旗形做空信号K线**，但市场从未触发入场，因为它没有跌破信号K线的低点。然而，作为一根看跌K线，它是一个小幅下跌。下一根K线是看涨趋势K线，然后又有一根看跌趋势K线。这第二根看跌趋势K线是一个小型第二段下跌，因此是一个**高2买入“交易机会”**。

---

##### 反转失败与顺势入场

第17根K线是牛市强劲日中第一次突破牛市微型通道，因此它是一个在其高点上方一个跳动点买入的**交易机会**。通道呈楔形，尽管交易者不会在这里做空，但做空的理论保护性买入止损是楔形高点上方一个跳动点。有一根大型看涨趋势K线穿过这些买入止损，表明对看跌情况的强劲拒绝。这根K线之所以如此强劲，是因为有多头预期第17根K线的做空会失败，因此在其高点上方设置买入止损做多，也有空头在第16根K线楔形顶部上方一个跳动点被止损离场。

第18根K线突破看涨趋势通道线并给出了**低2做空信号**。然而，在强劲趋势日中，聪明的交易者只会在首先出现强劲的看跌腿并突破趋势线时才做空。否则，他们会将所有做空“交易机会”视为买入“交易机会”，并在弱势做空者不得不平仓（例如第17和19根K线高点上方一个跳动点）的地方设置做多订单。

第19根K线是一根**单K线趋势线突破失败**，因此是一个买入“交易机会”。一个两K线牛市反转成为做多的信号。

>As shown in Figure 19.2, one peculiarity of trend days is that often the best-looking reversal bars and trend bars are countertrend, trapping traders into losing trades in the wrong direction (bars 1 through 8). Notice how there was not a single great bear reversal signal bar all day, yet this was a huge bear trend. Just look at the moving average—the market could not put two consecutive closes above it until the gap bar at the top of the rally that began with bar 8. This was a bear trend, and every buy should be viewed as a short entry setup. Just place your entry order exactly where the longs would have their protective stops and let them drive the market down as they liquidate.

##### 趋势日的特殊性：逆势信号的陷阱

如图19.2所示，趋势日的一个特点是，**通常看起来最好的反转K线和趋势K线实际上是逆势的**，这会将交易者引入错误的方向，导致亏损（例如第1到第8根K线）。请注意，在整个交易日中，没有出现一个真正的看跌反转信号K线，然而这却是一个巨大的熊市趋势。

---

##### 移动平均线的指示作用与反转交易策略

只需看看移动平均线——市场直到从第8根K线开始的反弹顶部，才出现了连续两个收盘价都在其上方。这是一个**熊市趋势**，因此所有的买入都应该被视为做空入场的**交易机会**。您只需将入场订单放置在多头会设置保护性止损的位置，然后让他们在平仓时推动市场下跌。

>The weak sell signals are a key reason why the trend is so relentless. Bears keep waiting for a strong signal bar, so that they can short their full position. Trapped bulls keep waiting for strong evidence that the trend is strong and that they need to exit immediately. The signs never come, and both the bulls and the bears keep waiting. They look at the trend and see lots of bull bars and two- or three-bar bull spikes, so assume and hope that this buying pressure will soon create a larger rally. Even if they see that the market cannot get above the moving average and that all of the pullbacks are very small, they deny these signs of a strong trend and keep hoping for the bulls to lift the market to a level where they feel more comfortable shorting. It never happens, and both the bears and the trapped longs continue to sell in pieces all day long, just in case the rally that they want never comes. Their relentless selling, along with the aggressive, relentless shorting by the strong bears who see this as the very strongest of bear trends, makes the market work lower and lower all day without any big pullback.

### 弱势卖出信号如何助推趋势

弱势的卖出信号是趋势如此**无情（relentless）** 的关键原因。空头们一直在等待一个强劲的信号K线，以便他们可以满仓做空。被套的多头则不断等待强有力的证据表明趋势强劲，他们需要立即出场。然而，这些信号从未出现，多头和空头都在持续等待。

他们观察趋势，看到许多看涨K线和两三K线的看涨**急涨**，因此假设并希望这种买盘压力很快会带来更大的反弹。即使他们看到市场无法突破移动平均线，并且所有回调都非常小，他们仍然否认这些强势趋势的迹象，并继续希望多头能将市场推高到他们觉得更舒服的做空水平。

---

### 持续下跌的市场心理

这种情况从未发生，空头和被套的多头都**全天分批卖出**，以防他们想要的反弹永远不会到来。他们无情的卖出，加上那些认为这是最强劲熊市趋势的强势空头积极、无情的做空，使得市场**全天持续走低，没有任何大的回调。**

>When traders cannot get filled on a limit order to buy at the close of the prior bar, the trend is strong. In Figure 19.3, as soon as bar 1 closed on its high, some traders would immediately place a limit order to buy at the price where that bar closed, hoping to get filled during the opening seconds of the next bar, bar 2. But since the low of bar 2 never dipped below the close of bar 1, the limit order would likely not get filled. Instead, the buyer would keep trying to buy higher. Bars 3, 4, and 5 were also very strong, although as soon as bar 3 closed, a trader who placed a limit order to buy at the level of that close would have been filled during the first few seconds of bar 4 because the low of bar 4 dipped one tick below the close of bar 3. Usually when there is a series of strong bars like that, they create a spike and the market typically then develops a bull channel.

##### 强势趋势的信号：限价单无法成交

当交易者无法以**限价单**在前一根K线收盘价处买入时，这表明趋势非常强劲。在图19.3中，第1根K线一收盘在其高点，一些交易者会立即放置一个限价单，以该K线收盘价买入，希望能**在第2根K线开盘的几秒钟内成交**。但是，由于第2根K线的低点从未跌破第1根K线的收盘价，这个限价单很可能不会成交。相反，买家会继续尝试以更高的价格买入。

---

##### 强势K线序列与趋势通道

第3、4、5根K线也非常强劲。尽管第3根K线一收盘，在那个收盘价放置限价买单的交易者会在第4根K线开盘的前几秒内成交，因为第4根K线的低点比第3根K线的收盘价低了一个跳动点。通常，当出现这样一系列强劲的K线时，它们会形成一个**急涨**，市场随后通常会发展出**牛市通道**。

>However, that is not always the case. The next day, bars 6 through 9 were also strong but they led to a lower high. Yesterday was a spike and channel bull trend day, so the start of the channel should get tested today. That was a downside magnet in the market, and when the market opened below yesterday's bull trend line, the lower high following the bars 6 to 9 spike led to a trend reversal down.

##### 并非总是如此：趋势的演变与反转

然而，情况并非总是如此。第二天，第6到第9根K线同样强劲，但它们却导致了一个**更低的高点**。

昨天是一个**急涨通道型牛市趋势日**，因此通道的起始点今天应该得到测试。这在市场中形成了一个**下行磁铁**，当市场开盘低于昨天的看涨趋势线时，第6到第9根急涨K线之后的更低高点导致了**趋势反转向下**。

>Stock traders would describe this bull channel up to yesterday's high as a crowded trade.Everyone who wanted to buy had already bought and there was no one left to buy. As the market started to fall, all of the buyers in the channel were quickly holding losing positions and then everyone rushed to the exits to minimize their losses and protect some of their profits. The result was that the market fell quickly.

##### 拥挤交易与市场快速下跌

股票交易者会将昨天高点前的这段牛市通道描述为一次**拥挤交易 (crowded trade)**。所有想买入的人都已经买入了，市场上没有剩余的买盘力量。

当市场开始下跌时，所有在通道中买入的交易者都迅速陷入亏损，然后所有人蜂拥出逃，以期最大限度地减少损失并保护部分利润。结果就是市场快速下跌。

>Deeper Discussion of This Chart
>The open broke out below the bull channel of yesterday's spike and channel in Figure 19.3,and bar 6 was a bull trend bar that set up a failed breakout long. The failed breakout became a lower high and breakout pullback short with a second entry below the bull bar that followed the 7:05 a.m. PST bear spike.

##### 图表深度解读：图19.3中的突破与反转

在图19.3中，开盘价跌破了昨日**急涨通道型牛市**的看涨通道，而第6根K线是一根看涨趋势K线，它形成了一个**失败的突破做多交易机会**。这个失败的突破演变为一个**更低的高点**和**突破回调做空交易机会**，并在太平洋标准时间上午7:05看跌急跌之后的看涨K线下方形成了第二次入场。
