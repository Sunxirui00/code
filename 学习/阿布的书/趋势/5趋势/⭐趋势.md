>A trend is a series of price changes that are mostly either up (a bull trend or a bull) or down (a bear trend or a bear). This is very important when it comes to trading because a trader usually should not be looking to buy unless the market is at least forming a higher low and should not be looking to short unless the market is at least forming a lower high. A trend can be as short as a single bar (remember, a trend bar is made up of a trend on a smaller time frame) or longer than all of the bars on your screen. Trends can be loosely classified into four overlapping and often interchangeable categories: trend, swing, pullback, and leg. The distinctions are just guidelines because each of the three smaller versions is a different version on different time frames. For example, a pullback in a bull trend on a 60 minute chart might be a strong bear trend on a 1 minute chart. Also, each category will contain one or more of the smaller versions. A trend might be made of 10 swings, each containing one to four pullbacks, and each pullback might have one to four legs. Every upswing and downswing of any size is commonly referred to as a leg, so the distinctions are not very important, but each term carries a subtle distinction with it.

##### 趋势的定义与分类

趋势是价格变化的一个系列，大部分时间是上涨（**牛市趋势**或**牛市**）或是下跌（**熊市趋势**或**熊市**）。这在交易中非常重要，因为交易者通常不应该在市场没有至少形成**更高低点**时考虑买入，也不应该在市场没有至少形成**更低高点**时考虑做空。

一个趋势可以短至一根K线（请记住，一根趋势K线是由更小时间框架上的趋势构成的），也可以长过你屏幕上所有的K线。趋势可以大致分为四个相互重叠且常常可互换的类别：**趋势（Trend）**、**摆动（Swing）**、**回调（Pullback）** 和 **腿（Leg）**。这些区分只是一些指导原则，因为这三个较小的版本在不同的时间框架上会呈现为不同的形态。例如，60分钟图上牛市趋势中的一个回调，在1分钟图上可能是一个强劲的熊市趋势。此外，每个类别都会包含一个或多个较小的版本。一个趋势可能由10个摆动组成，每个摆动包含一到四个回调，每个回调又可能有一到四条腿。任何大小的上涨或下跌都通常被称为一条**腿**，所以这些区分并不是非常重要，但每个术语都带有一些微妙的差异。

>At its simplest, a trend is present when the chart on your computer screen starts at one of the two left-hand corners and ends at the diagonally opposite corner of the screen without huge fluctuations in between. For example, if the bars on the left are near the lower left-hand corner of your monitor and the bars on the right are near the upper right-hand corner and there are not many large upswings and downswings in the middle of your screen, then this is a bull trend. Your personal radar can tell you if the market is more likely in a trend instead of in a strong leg within a trading range. If you have a sense of uncertainty, the market is more likely in a trading range. If instead you have a sense of urgency and you are hoping for a pullback,then the market is more likely in a trend.
##### 如何直观地判断趋势

最简单来说，当您电脑屏幕上的图表从左侧的两个角落之一开始，并在屏幕的对角线另一侧结束，中间没有出现巨大的波动时，**趋势**就存在了。

例如，如果K线在屏幕左下方，而右侧的K线在屏幕右上方，并且屏幕中间没有太多大幅度的上涨和下跌，那么这就是一个**牛市趋势**。

您的“个人雷达”可以帮助您判断市场是更可能处于趋势中，还是处于**交易区间**内的强劲“腿”中。如果您感到不确定，市场更有可能处于**交易区间**。反之，如果您有一种紧迫感，并且希望出现回调，那么市场更有可能处于**趋势**中。

>Trends can be very steep, with a series of trend bars with large bodies, very little overlap between adjacent bars, and small tails. This is the spike phase of a trend, and it can be as brief as a single bar. It is when the market becomes clearly always-in long in the eyes of most traders if the trend is a new bull trend, or always-in short in the case of a new bear trend. The market eventually begins to have some two-sided trading in the form of pullbacks, and the trend then transitions into the channel phase, which can last far longer than most traders expect is possible. Trends can have small spikes with big or small channels, or big spikes with big or small channels. The spikes can have some overlap between the bars and look more like a tight channel, and the channels can be steep with very little overlap between adjacent bars and look more like a large spike. The key point is that most trends tend to be very strong when starting out and then lose momentum as they mature, and the market eventually has larger pullbacks and evolves into a trading range. The trading range is simply a pullback on a higher time frame chart. At some point, the market breaks out into a spike in the opposite direction,and then the market reverses into a trend in the other direction.
##### 趋势的阶段与演变

趋势可能非常陡峭，表现为一系列实体较大、相邻K线之间重叠极少、影线很小的**趋势K线**。这是趋势的**急涨阶段（spike phase）**，它可以短至一根K线。在这个阶段，如果趋势是新的牛市趋势，在大多数交易者眼中市场会变得明显地“总是看涨”；如果是新的熊市趋势，则会变得“总是看跌”。

市场最终会以回调的形式开始出现一些双向交易，然后趋势过渡到**通道阶段（channel phase）**，这个阶段可能比大多数交易者预期的持续时间要长得多。趋势可以有小急涨配大或小通道，也可以有大急涨配大或小通道。急涨期间的K线之间可能有一些重叠，看起来更像是一个紧密通道；而通道也可能很陡峭，相邻K线之间重叠很少，看起来更像一个大急涨。

关键点在于，**大多数趋势在开始时往往非常强劲，然后随着成熟而失去动量，市场最终会出现更大的回调并演变为交易区间。** 交易区间在更高时间框架图表上，本质上只是一个回调。在某个时刻，市场会向相反方向突破，形成一次急涨，然后市场反转，进入另一个方向的趋势。

>A chart only shows one or two trends. If more than two trends are present on a chart, it is preferable to describe the trends by using one of the other three classifications because the two-sided action creates different trading opportunities. Both swings and legs are smaller trends, and there are at least two on the chart. The term swing is used when there are two or more smaller trends on the chart, even though the overall chart might be sideways.
##### 图表中的趋势与分类

一张图表通常只显示一到两个趋势。如果图表上存在超过两个趋势，最好使用其他三种分类（即摆动、回调和腿）来描述这些趋势，因为这种双向波动会创造不同的**交易机会**。

**摆动（swings）** 和 **腿（legs）** 都是更小的趋势，图表上至少会有两个。即使整体图表可能是横盘震荡的，“摆动”这个术语也会在图表上存在两个或更多较小趋势时使用。

>A leg is any smaller trend that is part of a larger trend; it can be a pullback (a countertrend move), a swing in a trend or in a sideways market, or a with-trend move that occurs between any two pullbacks within a trend.
##### 腿的定义与作用

**腿（Leg）** 是指任何作为更大趋势一部分的较小趋势；它可能是一个**回调**（逆势运动），一个趋势中或横盘市场中的**摆动**，或者是在趋势中任意两个回调之间发生的**顺势运动**。

>A pullback is a temporary countertrend move and is part of a trend, swing, or leg. For example, a bull pullback is a sideways to downward move in a bull trend, swing, or leg that will be followed by at least a test of the prior high. Any bar or series of bars that represents any pause or loss of momentum is a pullback, even if there is no actual backward movement. This includes a single inside bar, which obviously does not extend below the low or above the high of the prior bar. When it is a single bar, the bar is a pause bar or a pullback bar. These one-bar pullbacks are made up of a series of small swings on a smaller time frame chart. However, you might have to go all the way down to a 1 minute chart or a 100 tick or smaller chart to see them. This is a waste of time for a trader, but it is helpful to be aware of the reality because it provides a rationale for considering placing a trade.
##### 回调的定义与特点

**回调（Pullback）** 是一种暂时的逆势运动，它是趋势、摆动或“腿”的一部分。例如，一个**看涨回调**是牛市趋势、摆动或“腿”中的横盘或向下移动，之后至少会测试前期高点。

任何 K 线或一系列 K 线，只要代表着**任何暂停或动量损失**，就是一次回调，即使没有实际的反向运动。这包括一个**单根内包 K 线**，它显然没有延伸到前一根 K 线的低点下方或高点上方。当它是一根 K 线时，这根 K 线就是**暂停 K 线**或**回调 K 线**。

这些单 K 线回调是由更小时间框架图上的一系列小型摆动组成的。然而，你可能需要一直下探到1分钟图表或100跳动点甚至更小的图表才能看到它们。对于交易者来说，这是一种时间浪费，但了解这种真实情况是有帮助的，因为它为考虑下单提供了一个依据。

>Within any trend, there are a number of smaller opposite trends, some lasting for only one or two bars. All of them should be considered as likely to fail and therefore setups for trades in the direction of the larger trend. In a bull trend, the swings should be trending upward,meaning that each pullback should be above the prior pullback and result in a new high (trending highs and lows, or trending swings). All moves with strong momentum usually have at least a test of the extreme following a pullback (all strong moves usually have at least two legs, even if the second one falls short and reverses).
##### 趋势内的反向小趋势与顺势交易机会

在任何趋势中，都存在一些较小的反向趋势，其中有些仅持续一到两根K线。所有这些小趋势都应被视为**可能失败**，因此它们提供了**顺应更大趋势方向的交易机会**。

在一个牛市趋势中，**摆动（swings）** 应该呈现向上趋势，这意味着每一次回调都应高于上一次回调，并带来新高（形成趋势性高点和低点，或者说趋势性摆动）。所有具有强劲**动量**的走势，在回调之后通常至少会测试极端点位（所有强劲的走势通常至少有两“腿”，即使第二“腿”未能达到预期并反转）。

>All trends, no matter how small, must first break a trend line from the prior trend or a support or resistance line from a prior trading range, and then have trending swings (e.g., a series of higher highs and lows in a bull trend). Absent either of these, there is no trend. The best risk/reward ratio occurs when you enter on the first pullback after a trend line break, before there is a clearly established trend. As a possible trend day is unfolding, traders should look for signs of strength, each of which increases the odds that the trend will continue.

##### 趋势形成的条件

所有趋势，无论大小，都必须首先**突破**之前的趋势线，或者突破之前交易区间的**支撑或阻力线**。在此之后，趋势还需要有**连续的趋势波动**，例如在牛市中形成一系列的更高高点和更高低点。如果缺少这些条件中的任何一个，就不能称之为趋势。

---

##### 最佳交易机会

在**趋势线突破后的第一次回调**时入场，是获得最佳风险/回报比的时机，此时趋势尚未明确确立。

---

##### 趋势日中的交易策略

当一个潜在的趋势日正在展开时，交易者应该寻找**力量的迹象**，每一个迹象都会增加趋势持续的可能性。

>Why is it important to recognize the existence of a trend? Because then most of your trades should be in that direction and you must try to take every with-trend entry and rarely take countertrend entries. Depending on how you define a trend and a reversal attempt, about 80percent of attempts to reverse a trend will fail. Markets have inertia and tend to continue what they have just been doing. Because of this inertia, it makes far more mathematical sense to wait for the reversal attempt to fail and become simply a pullback in the trend and then enter in the direction of the trend. Incidentally, market inertia also means that if a market is in a trading range, it will resist breaking into a trend and about 80 percent of breakout attempts will fail.

##### 识别趋势的重要性

---

##### 顺势交易的必要性

认识到趋势的存在至关重要，因为这意味着您的大部分交易都应该**顺应趋势方向**。您应该尝试把握每一个顺势入场的**交易机会**，并极少进行逆势入场。

---

##### 趋势的惯性与反转的失败

根据您对趋势和反转尝试的定义，大约**80%的反转趋势的尝试都会失败**。市场具有惯性，倾向于延续当前的运动。由于这种惯性，从数学角度来看，更明智的做法是等待反转尝试失败，使其成为趋势中的一次简单回调，然后再**顺着趋势方向入场**。

---

##### 交易区间的惯性

顺带一提，市场惯性也意味着，如果市场处于交易区间内，它会抵制突破进入趋势，大约**80%的突破尝试也会失败**。

>The earlier you see the trend, the more money you stand to make. Focusing on the countertrend setups will likely make you miss the much more profitable but often scarier with-trend entries. The with-trend entries are scary because the market always looks overdone and it's hard to imagine that selling near the low of an overdone bear or buying near the high of an overdone bull could ever be profitable. However, that is exactly why it is! For example, in a bear trend, no one is sure if there is going to be a bounce where they can sell at a better price but everyone is sure that the market will be even lower very soon. Because of this,everyone is selling at the market or on tiny pullbacks, and larger pullbacks just don't materialize. The longs need to get out at any price and the bears want to get in at any price,because both believe the market is heading lower and they don't want to risk missing it while they wait or hope for a bounce.
##### 尽早识别趋势的重要性

---

##### 顺势入场的利润潜力

越早识别出趋势，您赚取利润的潜力就越大。过度关注逆势交易机会可能会让您错过利润更丰厚、但往往也更令人不安的**顺势入场**。

---

##### 顺势入场的心理挑战

顺势入场的**交易机会**之所以令人不安，是因为市场总是看起来“超买”或“超卖”。在过度下跌的熊市中于低点附近卖出，或在过度上涨的牛市中于高点附近买入，似乎都难以盈利。然而，这正是其盈利的原因所在！

---

##### 熊市中的交易行为示例

举例来说，在熊市中，没有人确定是否会有反弹让他们能在更好的价格卖出，但每个人都确信市场很快会进一步走低。正因如此，所有人都在市价卖出或在微小回调时卖出，而较大的回调根本不会出现。多头需要不惜一切代价离场，而空头则希望不惜一切代价入场，因为双方都相信市场将继续下跌，他们不想冒着等待或希望反弹而错过机会的风险。

>When a trend is especially strong, there is usually follow-through over the next one or more days. For example, if today was a huge bull trend day, especially if it was a reversal or a breakout and a possible start of a big move, the day will usually close near its high and the next day will also usually have a close above its open. This may continue for several days in a row. The opens often have sharp sell-offs that trap bulls out and bears in but usually find support at the 15 or 60 minute moving average or at some other support level (these are discussed in the section on support and resistance in book 2).
##### 强劲趋势的持续性

---
##### 强劲趋势的次日表现

当一个趋势特别强劲时，通常会在接下来的一天或几天内出现**持续的动能**。例如，如果今天是一个巨大的牛市趋势日，特别是如果它是一个反转日或突破日，并且可能预示着一波大行情的开始，那么当天通常会收盘在其高点附近，而第二天通常也会收盘价高于开盘价。这种情况可能会连续持续数天。

---
##### 开盘时的价格行为与支撑

开盘时经常会出现**急剧的抛售**，这会使看涨者被套，看跌者被困，但通常会在15分钟或60分钟移动平均线，或在其他一些支撑位（这些在第二本书的支撑和阻力部分有讨论）找到支撑。

>A trend is an area of relative certainty, where the odds are greater than 50-50 that the market will move X ticks further before it moves X ticks in the opposite direction. A trend is a series of spikes alternating with small trading ranges, and during each brief spike phase, the odds are better than 50-50, but in each trading range phase, uncertainty increases and the odds hover around 50-50 again. One of the difficulties in trading a trend is that the spike phases are often brief, and by the time you realize that one exists, there may not be enough ticks left with those increased odds to make a profit. Before you know it, a trading range forms and the odds are back to 50-50. One of the best ways to trade a trend is to anticipate when the next spike will begin and to enter on a stop as it is starting. That way, you can catch a spike with maybe a 60percent probability or even higher of making X ticks before losing X ticks, and if you become proficient at this, you will be a successful trader.

##### 趋势的本质与交易策略

---

### 趋势的定义与特征

趋势是市场中一个相对确定的区域，在这个区域内，市场向某个方向移动X个跳动点（ticks）的可能性，要高于其向相反方向移动X个跳动点的可能性，即**胜率大于50-50**。趋势表现为一系列**短暂的上涨或下跌（spikes）与小型交易区间交替出现**。在每次短暂的跳动阶段，胜率会超过50-50，但在每个交易区间阶段，不确定性会增加，胜率又会回到50-50左右。

---

### 趋势交易的挑战

交易趋势的难点之一在于，跳动阶段通常很短暂，等您意识到它存在时，可能剩下的、具有高胜率的跳动点数已经不足以让您获利了。很快，一个交易区间就形成了，胜率又回到了50-50。

---

### 最佳趋势交易机会

交易趋势的最佳方法之一是**预测下一次跳动何时开始**，并在跳动开始时通过止损单入场。这样，您就可以抓住一个成功率可能达到60%甚至更高的跳动，即在亏损X个跳动点之前，先赚取X个跳动点。如果您能精通这种方法，您将成为一名成功的交易者。

>Big traders don't hesitate to enter a trend during its spike phase, because they expect significant follow-through, even if there is a pullback immediately after their entry. If a pullback occurs, they increase the size of their position. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout lasting several bars, more and more institutions become convinced that the market has become always-in long with each new higher tick, and as they become convinced that the market will go higher, they start buying. This makes the spike grow very quickly. They have many ways to enter, like buying at the market, buying a one- or two-tick pullback, buying above the prior bar on a stop, or buying on a breakout above a prior swing high. It does not matter how they get in, because their focus is to get at least a small position on, and then look to buy more as the market moves higher, or if it pulls back. Because they will add on as the market goes higher, the spike can extend for many bars. A beginning trader sees the growing spike and wonders how anyone could be buying at the top of such a huge move. What they don't understand is that the institutions are so confident that the market will soon be higher that they will buy all the way up, because they don't want to miss the move while waiting for a pullback to form. The beginner is also afraid that his stop would have to be below the bottom of the spike, or at least below its midpoint, which is far away. The institutions know this, and simply adjust their position size down to a level where their dollars at risk are the same as for any other trade.
##### 大资金交易者的趋势交易策略

---

### 强劲趋势中的加仓行为

大型交易者在趋势的**跳动（spike）阶段**会毫不犹豫地入场，因为他们预期会有显著的后续走势，即使入场后立即出现回调。如果真的发生回调，他们还会**增加头寸规模**。

---

### 机构的买入行为驱动上涨

例如，如果一个强劲的牛市突破持续了几根K线，越来越多的机构会随着每一个新高点而确信市场已经进入“总是做多”的状态。当他们确信市场将走高时，便会开始买入。这使得跳动阶段的价格上涨非常迅速。

---

### 多样化的入场方式与核心理念

这些机构有多种入场方式，比如市价买入、买入一到两个跳动点的回调、在前一根K线上方挂止损单买入，或者在突破前一个摆动高点时买入。他们如何入场并不重要，因为他们的核心焦点是先**建立一个小的头寸**，然后随着市场走高，或者如果市场回调时，再伺机买入更多。由于他们会在市场走高时继续加仓，跳动阶段可以持续多根K线。

---

### 新手与机构的思维差异

新手交易者看到不断上涨的跳动，会困惑怎么会有人在这种巨大涨势的顶部买入。他们不理解的是，机构对市场很快会走高非常有信心，所以他们会一路买入，因为他们不想在等待回调时错过行情。新手还会担心止损点必须设置在跳动的底部，或至少中点以下，这距离很远。机构深知这一点，他们只是简单地**调整仓位大小**，将风险金额控制在与其他交易相同的水平。

>In every trend, no matter how strong, the market eventually pulls back a little. For example, if there is a strong bull breakout, or a trend from the open bull, where there is a bull spike made of four consecutive large bull trend bars with small tails, and then the fifth bar falls below the low of the prior bar, this is a pullback. If everyone is looking to buy a pullback, why would one ever develop? It is because not everyone is looking to buy. Experienced traders who bought early on look for price levels to take partial profits (they will begin to scale out of their longs),and sometimes they will sell out of their entire positions. These are not the bulls who are looking to buy a few ticks lower on the first pullback. The traders who are taking partial or full profits are afraid of a reversal, or of a deeper pullback, which would allow them to buy again many ticks lower. If they believed that the pullback was only going to last for a few ticks, and then the bull was going to resume, they never would have exited. They always take their profits at some resistance level, like a measured move target, a trend line, a trend channel line, or at the bottom of a trading range above the market. Most of the trading is done by computers, so everything has a mathematical basis, which means that the profit-taking targets are based on the prices that anyone can see on their screens. With practice, traders can learn to spot areas where the computers might take profits, and they can take their profits at the same prices, expecting a pullback to follow.
##### 趋势中的回调现象

---

### 回调的产生原因

在每一个趋势中，无论其力量多么强大，市场最终都会出现小幅回调。例如，在一个强劲的牛市突破中，或者一个从开盘就开始的牛市趋势中，如果出现由四根连续的大阳线（带小影线）组成的牛市“跳动”，而第五根K线跌破了前一根K线的低点，这就是一次回调。

如果每个人都在寻找买入回调的**交易机会**，为什么还会出现回调呢？这是因为并非所有交易者都在寻求买入。

---

### 经验丰富的交易者获利了结

那些早期买入的经验丰富的交易者会寻找价格水平来**部分获利了结**（他们会开始逐步减少多头仓位），有时甚至会完全平仓。这些人并不是那些希望在第一次回调时以低几个跳动点的价格买入的看涨者。

---

### 获利了结者的担忧与目标

这些部分或全部获利了结的交易者，是担心出现反转或更深的回调，这将使他们能够在更低的价格买回。如果他们相信回调只会持续几个跳动点，然后牛市就会恢复，他们就绝不会离场。他们总是在某些**阻力位**获利了结，比如衡量目标、趋势线、趋势通道线，或者市场上方交易区间的底部。

---

### 算法交易与可预测的获利点

由于大部分交易是由计算机完成的，所以一切都有其数学基础，这意味着获利目标是基于每个人都能在屏幕上看到的**价格**。通过练习，交易者可以学会识别计算机可能获利了结的区域，他们也可以在相同的价格点获利了结，预期随后会出现回调。

>Sometimes the spike will have a bar or a pattern that will allow aggressive bears to take a small scalp, if they think that the pullback is imminent and that there is enough room for a profitable short. However, most traders who attempt this will lose, because most of the pullbacks do not fall far enough for a profit, or the trader's equation is weak (the probability of making their scalp times the size of the profit is smaller than the probability of losing times the size of their protective stop). Also, traders who take the short are hoping so much for their small profit that they invariably end up missing the much more profitable long that forms a few minutes later.
##### 趋势中的逆势交易风险

---

### 激进做空者的短线交易机会

有时，在趋势的“跳动”（spike）阶段中，会出现一根K线或某种形态，这会让激进的看跌者有机会进行**小额剥头皮交易**（scalp）。前提是他们认为回调即将到来，并且有足够的空间进行有利可图的做空。

---

### 大多数逆势交易者的失败原因

然而，大多数尝试这种交易的交易者会蒙受损失。这是因为大部分回调并不会跌到足以获利的程度，或者交易者的**盈亏比不佳**（获得剥头皮利润的概率乘以利润大小，小于亏损的概率乘以止损大小）。

---

### 错过更大利润的风险

此外，进行这类做空交易的交易者，往往过于执着于他们的小额利润，结果总是**错过几分钟后出现的、利润丰厚得多的做多交易机会**。

>Some traders don't like to buy spikes because they don't like to risk too much. They prefer to feel like they are buying at a better price (a discount). These value bulls will only buy pullbacks and will wait for one to form. Other bulls who missed the initial buy or did not buy enough during the spike eagerly wait for the first pullback to buy or to add to their positions. They place limit orders at and below the low of the prior bar, hoping for a small dip, so that they can get long. Because of this, the first pullback usually only falls below the low of the prior bar by a few ticks. When the bulls are particularly aggressive, they will buy above the low of the prior bar, and what appeared to be a bar that would become a pullback bar might instead not fall below the low of the prior bar.
##### 不同交易者的回调买入策略

---

### 价值型交易者与回调买入

一些交易者不喜欢在“跳动”（spike）阶段买入，因为他们不愿承担过高的风险。他们更喜欢以**更优惠的价格**（即“折扣价”）买入，这些“价值型”看涨者只会买入回调，并会耐心等待回调形成。

---

### 错过机会者的追涨行为

另一些看涨者，他们可能错过了最初的买入机会，或者在跳动阶段买入不足，因此热切地等待第一次回调来买入或增加头寸。他们会在前一根K线的低点及以下位置设置限价订单，希望价格出现小幅下跌，以便能够做多。正因为如此，**第一次回调通常只会比前一根K线的低点低几个跳动点**。

---

### 激进买盘下的回调变化

当看涨者特别激进时，他们甚至会在前一根K线的低点上方买入，这时，原本看起来会成为回调K线的形态，反而可能**不会跌破前一根K线的低点**。

>If the bulls holding profitable longs think that the bull spike is weakening and that the next bar will trade below the low of the current bar, some will sell out of their longs at the market.Others will wait for the bar to close, and if the bar is not another strong bull trend bar, they will sell at the close of the bar, realizing that they might be selling too early, but happy with being able to sell at a high price. Eventually, there will be a true pullback bar, with a low below the low of the prior bar. Once there is, other bulls will place stop orders to buy above its high,because this bar is a high 1 buy setup in a strong bull spike and therefore a high probability buy setup. Some traders prefer to buy on stops above bars and not limit orders below bars because they want the market going in their direction when they enter, so that they will have the wind at their backs instead of in their faces. They are willing to exchange some of their potential profits for a higher probability of success. Both approaches are reasonable, if the trader's equation is favorable for their trades. Bull trends on higher time frame charts tend to have rallies in the final 30 to 60 minutes of trading on the 5 minute chart. Some of the buying is from mutual funds and some is from short covering, but much of it is simply statistically based program trading where the programmers have testing that shows that buying into the close in a bull trend is a profitable strategy. The strong finish often pushes the close above the open of the day. The result is a bull trend bar on the daily chart. When the market is in a bull trend, look for buy setups in the final hour. Likewise, when the daily chart is in a bear trend,look for sell setups in the final hour, as the 5 minute chart will often sell off into the close,causing the bar on the daily chart to be a bear trend bar.
##### 趋势回调中的交易机会与尾盘策略

---

### 看涨者的获利了结与回调的形成

如果持有盈利多头仓位的看涨者认为牛市“跳动”（spike）正在减弱，并且下一根K线将交易到当前K线的低点之下，一些人会选择**市价平仓**。另一些人则会等待K线收盘，如果该K线不是另一根强劲的牛市趋势K线，他们会在K线收盘时卖出，即使意识到可能卖得过早，但能以高价卖出也令他们满意。

最终，会出现一根真正的**回调K线**，其低点会低于前一根K线的低点。一旦出现这种情况，其他看涨者会在其高点上方设置止损订单来买入，因为这根K线在强劲的牛市跳动中是一个**高一买入机会**（High 1 buy setup），因此是一个高概率的买入机会。

---

### 不同入场方式的考量

有些交易者倾向于在K线上方通过止损单买入，而不是在K线下方使用限价单，因为他们希望入场时市场是朝着他们有利的方向移动，这样就能“顺风而行”，而不是“逆风而上”。他们愿意牺牲一部分潜在利润来换取更高的成功概率。只要交易者的盈亏比对他们的交易有利，这两种方法都是合理的。

---

### 高时间框架趋势与尾盘交易策略

在高时间框架图表上的牛市趋势，往往会在5分钟图表的交易时段的最后30到60分钟内出现**上涨行情**。其中一部分买盘来自共同基金，一部分来自空头回补，但很大一部分仅仅是基于统计的程序化交易，程序员通过测试发现，在牛市趋势中**临近收盘时买入是一种有利可图的策略**。这种强劲的收盘表现通常会将收盘价推至当日开盘价之上。结果就是日线图上形成一根牛市趋势K线。

当市场处于牛市趋势时，在**最后交易一小时内寻找买入机会**。同样地，当日线图处于熊市趋势时，在**最后交易一小时内寻找卖出机会**，因为5分钟图表通常会在临近收盘时下跌，导致日线图上形成一根熊市趋势K线。

>The most recent bars are at the top of your computer screen in a bull trend and at the bottom in a bear trend, and psychologically there does not appear to be any more room for the market to go further. The result is that many traders won't take a great buy signal at the top of a bull trend or sell signal at the bottom of a bear trend and will instead look for reversals. But that computer screen illusion has nothing to do with the market and if you can add space above or below the chart, there suddenly will be lots of room for the trend to run. The market draws in countertrend traders, and if you enter in the direction of the trend exactly where they exit at a loss, they will drive the market in your direction, even though the market looks so overextended.
##### 克服趋势末端的心理障碍

---

### 屏幕错觉与交易者的误判

在牛市趋势中，最新的K线显示在电脑屏幕的顶部；在熊市趋势中，则显示在屏幕底部。这种视觉呈现会造成一种心理错觉，让人感觉市场已经没有进一步移动的空间了。结果是，许多交易者不会在牛市趋势顶部抓住极佳的买入**交易机会**，也不会在熊市趋势底部抓住卖出信号，反而会去寻找反转机会。

---

### 认识市场真实潜力

然而，这种电脑屏幕造成的错觉与市场实际情况无关。如果您能**在图表上方或下方增加空白空间**，突然之间，趋势似乎就有了很大的运行空间。

---

### 逆势交易者的作用

市场会吸引逆势交易者入场。如果您恰好在他们亏损离场的地方顺着趋势方向入场，他们会**推动市场朝着您有利的方向发展**，即使市场看起来已经“超买”或“超卖”得非常严重。

>A move above a prior swing high in a bull trend will lead to predominantly one of three outcomes: more buying, profit taking (by far the most common possibility), or shorting. When the trend is strong, strong bulls will buy the breakout above the old high (they are "pressing,"or adding to, their longs) and there will be a measured move up of some kind. For example, if a bull trend forms a wedge top, but then breaks above the top of the wedge, if enough bulls are pressing their long, the market will often go up for a measured move that is equal to the height of the wedge. The bears will quickly see how strong the breakout is and will buy back their shorts. This urgent short covering adds fuel to the breakout and contributes to the size of the bull spike. The strong bears who were shorting during the wedge top will now see that their premise is wrong. They will expect about a measured move up and will quickly buy back their losing shorts and not consider shorting again for several bars and probably not until the market tests some resistance area, like the measured move target. This often leads to a strong bull breakout lasting one or more bars, with follow-through over the next several bars. If the move up is very strong, the bears might not look to sell again for dozens of bars and possibly even for the rest of the day.
##### 牛市趋势中突破前高后的市场行为

---

### 突破前高的三种主要结果

在牛市趋势中，当价格突破前一个摆动高点时，主要会导致以下三种结果：**更多的买入、获利了结（这是最常见的可能性）或做空**。

---

### 强劲趋势中的突破与量度走势

当趋势强劲时，强劲的看涨者会买入突破旧高的**交易机会**（他们正在“加码”或增加多头头寸），随后市场通常会出现某种形式的**量度走势（measured move）**。例如，如果一个牛市趋势形成了楔形顶部，但随后突破了楔形顶部，如果有足够多的看涨者在加码多头，市场通常会上涨一个等于楔形高度的量度走势。

---

### 空头回补助推上涨

看跌者会迅速意识到这次突破有多强劲，并会回补他们的空头头寸。这种**紧急的空头回补**为突破增添了动力，并促成了牛市“跳动”（spike）的规模。那些在楔形顶部做空的强劲看跌者会发现他们的判断是错误的。他们会预期大约一个量度走势的上涨，并会迅速回补他们亏损的空头头寸，在接下来的几根K线内可能不会再考虑做空，甚至可能直到市场测试某个阻力区域（如量度走势目标）才会再次考虑。

---

### 强劲突破与后续走势

这种情况常常导致**强劲的牛市突破持续一根或多根K线**，并在接下来的几根K线内有后续走势。如果上涨非常强劲，看跌者可能在几十根K线内，甚至可能在当天剩余的时间内，都不会再寻找卖出机会。

>Whenever the market goes up far enough above the breakout to enable a trader to make at least a profitable scalp before there is a pullback, then assume that there was mostly new buying at the high. If it goes sideways, assume that there was profit taking and that the bulls are looking to buy again a little lower. If the market reverses down hard, assume that the strong bears dominated at the new high and that the market will likely trade down for at least a couple of legs and at least 10 bars.
##### 突破后市场行为的解读

---

### 突破后继续上涨的解读

当市场在突破后上涨到足以让交易者在回调前至少获得**短线利润（profitable scalp）**时，通常可以假定在高点区域主要是**新的买盘**进入。

---

### 突破后横盘的解读

如果市场在突破后出现横盘整理，那么可以假定这主要是**获利了结**行为，并且看涨者正在寻求在稍低的价格再次买入。

---

### 突破后强劲反转的解读

如果市场在突破后出现强劲的**向下反转**，那么可以假定在新的高点区域，强劲的看跌者占据了主导地位，市场很可能会向下交易至少**两段腿（two legs）并持续至少10根K线**。

>In the absence of some rare, dramatic news event, traders don't suddenly switch from extremely bullish to extremely bearish. There is a gradual transition. A trader becomes less bullish, then neutral, and then bearish. Once enough traders make this transition, the market reverses into a deeper correction or into a bear trend. Every firm has its own measure of excess, and at some point enough firms decide that the trend has gone too far. They believe that there is little risk of missing a great move up if they stop buying above the old high, and they will buy only on pullbacks. If the market hesitates above the old high, the market is becoming two-sided, and the strong bulls are using the new high to take profits.
##### 市场情绪的逐步转变与趋势反转

---

### 市场情绪的渐进式转变

除非发生罕见且戏剧性的新闻事件，交易者的情绪并不会突然从极度看涨转变为极度看跌。这是一个**渐进的转变过程**：交易者会变得不那么看涨，然后转为中性，最后变为看跌。当足够多的交易者完成这种转变后，市场就会反转，进入更深度的回调或熊市趋势。

---

### 机构的过度衡量与买入策略调整

每家公司都有自己衡量“过度”的标准，当达到某个点时，足够多的公司会认为趋势已经走得太远了。他们相信，如果停止在旧高点上方买入，错过大涨行情的风险很小，因此他们只会**在回调时买入**。

---

### 市场由单边转为双边

如果市场在旧高点上方出现犹豫不决，这意味着市场正在变得**双边化**，强劲的看涨者正在利用这个新高点来获利了结。

>Profit taking means that traders are still bullish and are looking to buy a pull-back. Most new highs are followed by profit taking. Every new high is a potential top, but most reversal attempts fail and become the beginnings of bull flags, only to be followed by another new high. If a rally to test the high has several small pullbacks within the leg up, with lots of overlapping bars, several bear bodies, and big tails on the tops of the bars, and most of the bull trend bars are weak, then the market is becoming increasingly two-sided. The bulls are taking profits at the tops of the bars and buying only at the bottoms of the bars, and the bears are beginning to short at the tops of the bars. Similarly, the bulls are taking profits as the market approaches the top of the bull trend, and the bears are shorting more. If the market goes above the bull high, it is likely that the profit taking and shorting will be even stronger.
##### 获利了结与趋势延续

---

### 获利了结与新的交易机会

**获利了结**意味着交易者仍然看涨，并正在寻找买入回调的**交易机会**。大多数新高之后都会伴随着获利了结。每一个新高都是潜在的顶部，但大多数反转尝试都会失败，反而成为牛市旗形（bull flags）的开始，随后便是另一个新高。

---

### 市场双边化的迹象

如果一次测试高点的上涨过程中，内部有几个小幅回调，并且K线之间大量重叠，出现多根看跌K线实体，以及K线顶部有大影线，同时大部分看涨趋势K线表现疲软，那么市场正在变得越来越**双边化**。看涨者正在K线顶部获利了结，并且只在K线底部买入，而看跌者则开始在K线顶部做空。

---

### 趋势顶部附近的交易行为

类似地，随着市场接近牛市趋势的顶部，看涨者会获利了结，看跌者会增加做空。如果市场突破牛市高点，获利了结和做空的力量可能会变得更加强劲。

>Most traders do not like to reverse, so if they are anticipating a reversal signal, they prefer to exit their longs and then wait for that signal. The loss of these bulls on the final leg up in the trend contributes to the weakness of the rally to the final high. If there is a strong reversal down after the market breaks above the prior high, the strong bears are taking control of the market, at least for the near term. Once that happens, then the bulls who were hoping to buy a small pullback believe instead that the market will fall further. They therefore wait to buy until there is a much larger pullback, and their absence of buying allows the bears to drive the market down into a deeper correction, lasting 10 or more bars and often having two or more legs.
##### 趋势反转前的市场行为

---

### 交易者的离场与上涨动能减弱

多数交易者不喜欢反向操作，所以如果他们预期会出现反转信号，他们宁愿**退出多头仓位**，然后等待那个信号。这些看涨者在趋势的最后一段上涨中的离场，导致了最终高点上涨动能的减弱。

---

### 强劲反转后的市场控制权易手

如果市场在突破前高后出现**强劲的向下反转**，这意味着强劲的看跌者正在控制市场，至少在短期内如此。一旦这种情况发生，那些原本希望买入小幅回调的看涨者，会转而相信市场将进一步下跌。

---

### 深度回调的形成

因此，他们会等待更大幅度的回调才买入，而他们买盘的缺席使得看跌者能够将市场推入更深的调整，这种调整通常会**持续10根或更多K线，并常有两段或更多下跌**。

>There is one situation where the breakout in a bull trend is routinely met by aggressive shorts who will usually take over the market. A pullback is a minor trend in the opposite direction,and traders expect it to end soon and for the larger trend to resume. When there is a pullback in a strong bear trend, the market will often have two legs up in the minor bull trend. As the market goes above the high of the first leg up, it is breaking out above a prior swing high in a minor bull trend. However, since most traders will see the move up as a pullback that will end very soon, the dominant traders on the breakout will usually be aggressive sellers, instead of aggressive new buyers or profit-taking longs, and the minor bull trend will usually reverse back down into the direction of the major bear trend after breaking out above the first or second swing high in the pullback.
##### 熊市趋势中回调的突破与激进做空

---

在某些情况下，即使是牛市中的突破，也会**经常遭遇激进的空头**，这些空头通常会掌控市场。

回调是与主趋势相反的次要趋势，交易者通常预期它会很快结束，并且主要趋势将恢复。

---

### 强劲熊市趋势中的回调特性

在一个强劲的熊市趋势中，市场往往会在次要的牛市回调中**形成两段上涨（two legs up）**。当市场突破第一段上涨的高点时，这实际上是在一个次要的牛市趋势中突破了之前的一个摆动高点。

---

### 突破后的激进卖盘

然而，由于大多数交易者会将这次上涨视为即将结束的回调，因此在这次突破中占据主导地位的交易者通常是**激进的卖方**，而不是激进的新买家或获利了结的多头。这种次要的牛市趋势在突破了回调中的第一个或第二个摆动高点后，通常会**反转回落，顺着主要的熊市趋势方向继续运行**。

>The same is true of new lows in a bear trend. When the bear trend is strong, strong bears will press their shorts by adding to their positions on the breakout to a new low and the market will continue to fall until it reaches some measured move target. As the trend weakens, the price action at a new low will be less clear, which means that the strong bears are using the new low as an area to take profits on their shorts rather than as an area to add to their shorts.As the bear trend further loses strength, eventually the strong bulls will see a new low as a great price to initiate longs and they will be able to create a reversal pattern and then a significant rally.
##### 熊市新低点的市场行为

---

### 强劲熊市中的新低与加码

熊市中的新低点也遵循与牛市突破相似的逻辑。当熊市趋势强劲时，强劲的看跌者会通过在突破新低时增加仓位来“加码”做空，市场会继续下跌，直到达到某个**量度走势（measured move）目标**。

---

### 趋势减弱时的获利了结

随着趋势减弱，新低点附近的价格行为会变得不那么清晰。这意味着强劲的看跌者正在利用新低点作为**获利了结**空头仓位的区域，而不是增加空头仓位的区域。

---

### 趋势反转与看涨者的介入

随着熊市趋势进一步失去力量，最终强劲的看涨者会认为新低点是一个极好的价格来**建立多头仓位**。他们将能够创造一个反转形态，并随后引发一次显著的上涨。

>As a trend matures, it usually transitions into a trading range, but the first trading ranges that form are usually followed by a continuation of the trend. How do the strong bulls and bears act as a trend matures? In a bull trend, when the trend is strong, the pullbacks are small because the strong bulls want to buy more on a pullback. Since they suspect that there may not be a pullback until the market is much higher, they begin to buy in pieces, but relentlessly.They look for any reason to buy, and with so many big traders in the market, there will be some buying for every imaginable reason. They place limit orders to buy a few ticks down and other limit orders to buy a few ticks above the low of the prior bar, at the low of the prior bar,and below the low of the prior bar. They place stop orders to buy above the high of the prior bar and on a breakout above any prior swing high. They also buy on the close of both any bull or bear trend bar. They see the bear trend bar as a brief opportunity to buy at a better price and the bull trend bar as a sign that the market is about to move up quickly.
---

## 成熟趋势中的机构行为

随着趋势的成熟，它通常会过渡到一个交易区间，但最初形成的交易区间通常会伴随着趋势的延续。

### 强劲牛市中的多头行为

在牛市趋势中，当趋势强劲时，回调幅度很小，因为**强劲的看涨者希望在回调时买入更多**。由于他们怀疑市场可能不会出现回调，直到价格高出许多，所以他们开始**分批但持续地买入**。他们寻找任何买入的理由，并且由于市场中有如此多的巨头交易者，每一次可以想象到的理由都会引发一些买入。

他们会：

- 设置限价订单，在当前价格下方几档买入。
    
- 在或低于前一根K线的低点附近设置限价订单买入。
    
- 在前一根K线高点上方和突破任何前一个摆动高点时设置止损订单买入。
    
- 在任何看涨或看跌趋势K线收盘时买入。
    

他们将看跌趋势K线视为以更好价格买入的短暂**交易机会**，而将看涨趋势K线视为市场即将快速上涨的信号。

>The strong bears are smart and they see what is going on. Since they believe, just like the strong bulls, that the market is going to be higher before long, it does not make sense for them to be shorting. They just step aside and wait until they can sell higher. How much higher? Each institution has its own measure of excess, but once the market gets to a price level where enough bear firms believe that it might not go any higher, they will begin to short.If enough of them short around the same price level, more and larger bear trend bars form and bars start to get tails on the tops. These are signs of selling pressure and they tell all traders that the bulls are becoming weaker and the bears are becoming stronger. The strong bulls eventually stop buying above the last swing high and instead begin to take profits as the market goes to a new high. They are still bullish but are becoming selective and will buy only on pullbacks. As the two-sided trading increases and the sell-offs have more bear trend bars and last for more bars, the strong bulls will want to buy only at the bottom of the developing trading range and will look to take profits at the top. The strong bears begin to short at new highs and they are now willing to scale in higher. They might take partial profits near the bottom of the developing trading range if they think that the market might reverse back up and break out to a new high, but they will keep looking to short new highs. At some point, the market becomes a 50-50 market and neither the bulls nor bears are in control; eventually the bears become dominant, a bear trend begins, and the opposite process unfolds.
---

### 强劲看跌者的等待与介入

强劲的看跌者非常聪明，他们会看清市场局势。由于他们和强劲的看涨者一样，认为市场在不久的将来会走高，因此此时做空对他们来说并没有意义。他们会**暂时观望，直到能够在更高点卖出**。

那么，究竟高到什么程度呢？每家机构都有自己衡量市场“过度”的标准，但一旦市场达到某个价格水平，足够多的看跌机构认为市场可能不会再走高时，他们就会开始做空。

---

### 卖压的出现与市场平衡的转变

如果足够多的看跌者在同一个价格水平附近做空，就会形成更多更大根的看跌趋势K线，并且K线顶部开始出现影线。这些都是**卖压的迹象**，它们告诉所有交易者，看涨者正在变弱，看跌者正在变强。

强劲的看涨者最终会停止在最后一个摆动高点上方买入，转而开始在市场创新高时获利了结。他们仍然看涨，但变得更有选择性，只会**在回调时买入**。

---

### 市场进入双边交易与最终反转

随着双边交易的增加，抛售出现更多的看跌趋势K线并持续更长时间，强劲的看涨者将只想在正在形成的交易区间底部买入，并会寻求在顶部获利了结。

与此同时，强劲的看跌者开始在新高点做空，并且现在愿意在高位分批建仓。如果他们认为市场可能会反转上涨并突破新高，他们可能会在正在形成的交易区间底部附近部分获利了结，但他们会持续寻找做空新高的**交易机会**。

在某个时刻，市场会变成一个**50-50的市场**，看涨者和看跌者都无法掌控局势；最终，看跌者会占据主导地位，熊市趋势开始，然后就会出现相反的过程。

>A trend that has gone on for 30 or more bars will often have an unusually strong breakout, but it can be an exhaustive climax. For example, in a protracted bull trend, all strong bulls and bears love to see a large bull trend bar or two, especially if it is exceptionally large, because they expect it to be a brief, unusually great opportunity. Once the market is close to where the strong bulls and bears want to sell, like near a measured move target or a trend channel line,especially if the move is the second or third consecutive buy climax, they step aside. The absence of selling by the strongest traders results in a vacuum above the market, which creates one or two relatively large bull trend bars. This bull spike is just the sign that the strong traders have been waiting for, and once it is there, they appear as if out of nowhere and begin their selling. The bulls take profits on their longs and the bears initiate new shorts. Both sell aggressively at the close of the bar, above its high, at the close of the next bar (especially if it is a weaker bar), and at the close of the following bar, especially if the bars are starting to have bear bodies. They also sell below the low of the prior bar. When they see a strong bear trend bar, they sell at its close and below its low. Both the bulls and the bears expect a larger correction, and the bulls will not consider buying again until at least a 10-bar, two-legged correction, and even then, only if the sell-off looks weak. The bears expect the same sell-off and will not be eager to take profits too early.
##### 长期趋势的耗竭性高潮与反转

---

### 趋势末期的异常强劲突破

持续30根或更多K线的趋势，通常会出现异常强劲的突破，但这可能是一个**耗竭性高潮（exhaustive climax）**。例如，在一个旷日持久的牛市趋势中，所有强劲的看涨者和看跌者都乐于看到一两根大的牛市趋势K线，特别是当它异常巨大时，因为他们预期这将是一个短暂、异常好的**交易机会**。

---

### 强劲交易者的退场与市场真空

一旦市场接近强劲的看涨者和看跌者希望卖出的位置，例如接近量度走势目标或趋势通道线，特别是如果这次上涨是连续第二次或第三次买入高潮，他们就会**选择观望**。最强劲的交易者停止卖出，导致市场上方出现“真空”，从而产生一两根相对较大的牛市趋势K线。

---

### 强劲交易者的介入与激进卖出

这次牛市“跳动”（spike）正是强劲交易者一直在等待的信号。一旦它出现，他们就会像凭空出现一样，开始他们的卖出。看涨者会对其多头头寸进行获利了结，而看跌者则会开立新的空头头寸。双方都会积极地：

- 在K线收盘时卖出。
    
- 在K线高点上方卖出。
    
- 在下一根K线收盘时卖出（特别是如果它是一根较弱的K线）。
    
- 在随后的K线收盘时卖出，尤其当K线开始出现看跌实体时。
    
- 在前一根K线低点下方卖出。
    

当他们看到一根强劲的看跌趋势K线时，他们会在其收盘时及其低点下方卖出。

---

### 对深度回调的共同预期

看涨者和看跌者都预期会出现更大的回调。看涨者在至少一个10根K线、两段式（two-legged）的回调发生之前，都不会考虑再次买入，即便如此，也只有在抛售看起来疲软时才会考虑。看跌者预期会有同样的抛售，因此不会急于过早获利了结。

>Weak traders see that large bull trend bar in the opposite way. The weak bulls, who had been sitting on the sidelines hoping for an easy pullback to buy, see the market running away from them and want to make sure they catch this next leg up, especially since the bar is so strong and the day is almost over. The weak bears, who shorted early and maybe scaled in, were terrified by the rapidity with which the bar broke to a new high. They are afraid of relentless follow-through buying, so they buy back their shorts. These weak traders are trading on emotion and are competing against computers, which do not have emotion as one of the variables in their algorithms. Since the computers control the market, the emotions of the weak traders doom them to big losses on big bull trend bars at the end of an overdone bull trend.
##### 弱势交易者在趋势高潮中的错误行为

---

### 弱势交易者的错误解读

弱势交易者对那根大型看涨趋势K线的看法截然不同。那些一直观望、希望等到一次简单的回调再买入的**弱势看涨者**，看到市场正在远离他们，便急于确保能抓住这最后一波上涨，特别是考虑到这根K线如此强劲，而且交易日也接近尾声。

---

### 弱势空头的恐慌回补

那些过早做空、可能还分批建仓的**弱势看跌者**，则被这根K线迅速突破新高所带来的速度吓坏了。他们害怕随之而来的无情买盘，于是回补他们的空头头寸。

---

### 情绪化交易的后果

这些弱势交易者是**基于情绪进行交易**，而他们正在与没有将情绪作为算法变量的计算机竞争。由于计算机控制着市场，弱势交易者的情绪注定会让他们在过度看涨趋势末期的大型看涨趋势K线中遭受巨大损失。

>Once a strong bull begins to have pullbacks that are relatively large, the pull-backs, which are always small trading ranges, behave more like trading ranges than bull flags. The direction of the breakout becomes less certain and traders begin to think that a downside breakout is about as likely as an upside breakout. Anew high is now a breakout attempt above a trading range, and the odds are that it will fail. Likewise, once a strong bear trend begins to have relatively large pullbacks, those pullbacks behave more like trading ranges than bear flags,and therefore a new low is an attempt to break below a trading range and the odds are that it will fail.
##### 趋势回调性质的转变

---

### 强劲牛市回调的特征变化

一旦一个强劲的牛市开始出现相对较大的回调，这些回调（通常是小型的交易区间）的行为会**更像交易区间，而不是牛市旗形**。这意味着突破的方向变得不那么确定，交易者开始认为向下突破的可能性与向上突破大致相同。

此时，创新高不再是牛市的延续，而更像是**对交易区间的向上突破尝试**，并且这种尝试失败的几率较高。

---

### 强劲熊市回调的类似变化

同理，一旦一个强劲的熊市开始出现相对较大的回调，这些回调的行为会**更像交易区间，而不是熊市旗形**。因此，创新低是一种**试图突破交易区间下沿的尝试**，这种尝试失败的几率同样较高。

>Every trading range is within either a bull trend or a bear trend. Once the two-sided trading is strong enough to create the trading range, the trend is no longer strong, at least while the trading range is in effect. There will always be a breakout from the range eventually, and if it is to the upside and it is very strong, the market is in a strong bull trend. If it is to the downside and strong, the market is in a strong bear trend.
##### 交易区间与趋势的关系

---

### 交易区间与趋势强度的关联

每个交易区间都存在于牛市趋势或熊市趋势之中。一旦双向交易足够强劲以形成交易区间，那么至少在交易区间存在期间，**趋势就不再强劲**。

---

### 交易区间的最终突破

最终，交易区间总会发生突破。如果向上突破且非常强劲，则市场处于**强劲的牛市趋势**。如果向下突破且强劲，则市场处于**强劲的熊市趋势**。

>Once the bears are strong enough to push a pullback well below the bull trend line and the moving average, they are confident enough that the market will likely not go much higher and they will aggressively short above the old high. At this point, the bulls will have decided that they should buy only a deep pullback. A new mind-set is now dominant at the new high. It is no longer a place to buy, because it no longer represents much strength. Yes, there is profit taking by the bulls, but most big traders now look  at the new high as a great opportunity to initiate shorts. The market has reached the tipping point and most traders have stopped looking to buy small pullbacks and instead are looking to sell rallies. The bears are dominant and the strong selling will likely lead to a large correction or even a trend reversal. After the next strong push down, the bears will look for a lower high to sell again or to add to their short positions, and the bulls who bought the pullback will become concerned that the trend might have reversed or at least that there will be a much larger pullback. Instead of hoping for a new bull high to take profits on their longs, they will now take profits at a lower high and not look to buy again until after a larger correction.
##### 趋势逆转中的市场行为转变

---

### 熊市力量增强与多头思维转变

一旦空头足够强大，将回调推至牛市趋势线和移动平均线**下方很远**，他们就会变得足够自信，认为市场不太可能再涨很多，并会积极地在前高点上方做空。此时，多头将决定只在**深度回调时买入**。

---

### 新高点心态的转变

一种新的心态现在在新高点占据主导地位。它不再是买入的地点，因为它不再代表太多力量。是的，多头有获利了结，但大多数大型交易者现在将新高点视为一个绝佳的**建立空头仓位**的**交易机会**。

---

### 市场转折点与空头主导

市场已达到**转折点**，大多数交易者已不再寻求买入小幅回调，而是转为寻找卖出反弹的机会。空头占据主导地位，强劲的抛售很可能导致一次大幅修正，甚至趋势反转。

---

### 空头与多头的后续策略

在下一次强劲下跌之后，空头将寻找**更低的高点**再次卖出或增加他们的空头仓位。而那些买入回调的多头将开始担心趋势可能已经逆转，或者至少将出现一次更大的回调。他们不再希望通过新的牛市高点来获利了结，而是会在**更低的高点获利了结**，并且在出现更大的修正之前，不再考虑再次买入。

>There will still be bulls who bought much lower and want to give the bull trend every possible chance to resume. Traders know that most reversal attempts fail, and many who rode the trend up will not exit their longs until after the bears have demonstrated the ability to push the market down hard. Many longs bought puts to protect themselves in case of a severe reversal. The puts allow them to hold on to give the bull trend every possible chance to resume. They know that the puts limit their losses, no matter how far the market might fall,but once they see this impressive selling pressure, they will then look for a rally to finally exit their longs, and as that rally begins, they will take profits on their puts. Also, most of their puts expire within a few months, and once expired, the traders no longer have downside protection. This means that they cannot continue to hold on to their positions unless they keep buying more and more puts. If they believe that the market will likely fall further and not rally again for many months, it does not make sense to continue to pay for ongoing put protection. Instead, they will look to sell out of their positions. Their supply will limit the rally,and their selling, added to the shorting by aggressive bears and the profit taking by bulls who saw the sell-off as a buying opportunity, will create a second leg down.
##### 趋势末期多头的坚持与最终离场

---

### 多头的信念与保护性期权

仍然会有一些在更低价位买入的看涨者，他们希望给予牛市趋势一切可能的机会来恢复。交易者知道大多数反转尝试都会失败，许多搭乘趋势上涨的交易者，在空头表现出将市场强劲向下推动的能力之前，不会退出他们的多头仓位。许多多头会购买看跌期权来保护自己，以防出现剧烈反转。看跌期权让他们能够继续持有，从而给予牛市趋势一切可能的机会来恢复。

---

### 保护失效后的最终卖出

他们知道看跌期权限制了他们的损失，无论市场可能下跌多远。但一旦他们看到这种令人印象深刻的卖压，他们就会寻找一次反弹来最终退出他们的多头仓位，并且随着那次反弹的开始，他们会对看跌期权进行获利了结。

此外，他们的大部分看跌期权会在几个月内到期，一旦到期，交易者就不再有下行保护。这意味着除非他们继续购买越来越多的看跌期权，否则他们无法继续持有仓位。如果他们认为市场很可能会进一步下跌，并且在未来几个月内不会再次反弹，那么继续支付期权保护费用就没有意义了。

---

### 市场下跌的合力

相反，他们会寻求卖出他们的仓位。他们的卖压将限制反弹，而他们的卖出，加上激进空头的做空，以及那些将抛售视为买入**交易机会**的看涨者的获利了结，将共同**创造第二段下跌**。

>These persistent bulls will each have a price level on the downside that, if reached, will make them want to exit on the next rally. As the market keeps working lower, more and more of these bulls will decide that the bull trend will not resume anytime soon and that the trend might have reversed into a bear trend. These remaining die-hard longs will wait patiently for a pullback in the bear swing to exit their longs, and their positions represent a supply that is overhanging the market. They sell below the most recent swing high because they doubt that the market will be able to get above a prior swing high, and are happy to get out at any price above the most recent low. Bears will also look for a pullback from each new low to add to their shorts and place new shorts. The result is a series of lower highs and lows, which is the definition of a bear trend.
##### 持有多头的最终离场与熊市的形成

---

### 顽固多头的心理价位与离场时机

这些顽固的看涨者每个人都有一个下行价格水平，一旦达到这个水平，他们就会希望在下一次反弹时退出。随着市场持续走低，越来越多的这些看涨者将断定牛市趋势不会很快恢复，并且趋势可能已经逆转为熊市。

---

### 多头头寸的供给与对反弹的限制

这些剩余的死忠多头将耐心等待熊市波段中的一次回调，以退出他们的多头仓位，而他们的仓位代表着**压在市场上方的供给**。他们在最近的摆动高点下方卖出，因为他们怀疑市场能否突破前一个摆动高点，并且乐意以高于最近低点的任何价格离场。

---

### 熊市趋势的确立

看跌者也将寻找每一次新低后的回调，以增加他们的空头仓位或建立新的空头仓位。结果就是形成一系列**更低的高点和更低的低点**，这正是熊市趋势的定义。


>If the market enters a bear trend, the process will reverse. When the bear trend is strong,traders will short below prior lows. As the trend weakens, the bears will take profits at new lows and the market will likely enter a trading range. After a strong rally above the bull trend line and the moving average, the bears will take profits at a new low and strong bulls will aggressively buy and try to take control of the market. The result will be a larger bear rally or possibly a reversal into a bull trend.
##### 熊市趋势的反转过程

---

### 强劲熊市与交易区间形成

如果市场进入熊市趋势，整个过程将会反转。当熊市趋势强劲时，交易者会在先前低点下方做空。随着趋势减弱，看跌者会在新低点获利了结，市场很可能进入一个**交易区间**。

---

### 熊市反弹与潜在反转

在市场强劲反弹突破看涨趋势线和移动平均线之后，看跌者会在新低点获利了结，而强劲的看涨者会积极买入并试图控制市场。结果将是出现一个更大的熊市反弹，或者**可能反转进入牛市趋势**。

>A similar situation occurs when there is a pullback that is large enough to make traders wonder if the trend has reversed. For example, if there is a deep, sharp pullback in a bull trend, traders will begin to look at moves below prior swing lows, but this is in the context of a pullback in a bull trend instead of as part of a bear trend. They will watch what happens as the market falls below a prior swing low. Will the market fall far enough for bears, who entered on a sell stop below that swing low, to make a profit? Did the new low find more sellers than buyers? If it did, that is a sign that the bears are strong and that the pullback will probably go further. The trend might even have reversed to down.
##### 回调过深引发的趋势反转疑虑

---

### 深度回调的出现与交易者的疑问

当回调大到足以让交易者怀疑趋势是否已经逆转时，会出现类似的情况。例如，如果在牛市趋势中出现一个**深度、急剧的回调**，交易者将开始关注价格跌破先前摆动低点的情况，但此时的背景是牛市中的回调，而不是熊市的一部分。他们会密切关注市场跌破先前摆动低点后的表现。

---

### 新低点卖压的判断

市场会跌到足够低，让那些在摆动低点下方设置卖出止损的空头获利吗？新的低点是否吸引了比买家更多的卖家？如果确实如此，这表明空头很强，并且回调可能会进一步深入。甚至，**趋势可能已经向下逆转**。

>Another possibility on the breakout to a new low is that the market enters a trading range,which is evidence that the shorts took profits and that there was unimpressive buying by the bulls. The final alternative is that the market reverses up after the breakout to a new low. This means that there were strong bulls below that swing low just waiting for the market to test there. This is a sign that the sell-off is more likely just a big pullback in an ongoing bull trend.The shorts from higher up took profits on the breakout to the new low because they believed that the trend was still upward. The strong bulls bought aggressively because they believed that the market would not fall further and that it would rally to test the bull high.
##### 突破新低后的其他可能性

---

### 突破新低后进入交易区间

突破新低后的另一种可能性是市场进入**交易区间**。这是空头获利了结，且多头买盘乏力的证据。

---

### 突破新低后向上反转

最后一种可能性是市场在突破新低后**向上反转**。这意味着在那个摆动低点下方有强大的多头正在等待市场测试该区域。这是抛售更可能只是一个持续牛市趋势中大回调的迹象。

---

### 强劲多头的买入逻辑

那些在更高位做空的交易者在突破新低时获利了结，因为他们相信趋势仍然是向上的。强大的多头积极买入，因为他们相信市场不会进一步下跌，并且会反弹以测试牛市高点。

>Whenever there is any breakout below a swing low, traders will watch carefully for evidence that the bulls have returned or that the bears have taken control. They need to decide what influence is greatest at the new low, and they use the market's behavior to make that decision. If there is a strong breakout, then new selling is dominant. If the market's movement is uncertain, then profit taking by the shorts and weak buying by the bulls is taking place, and the market will likely enter a trading range. If there is a strong reversal up, then aggressive buying by the longs is the most important factor.
##### 跌破摆动低点后的市场力量判断

---

### 跌破摆动低点后的关注焦点

每当价格跌破摆动低点时，交易者都会密切关注**多头回归或空头掌控的证据**。他们需要判断在新低点处哪种影响力最大，并利用市场行为来做出决定。

---

### 不同市场行为的解读

- 如果出现**强劲的向下突破**，则说明新的卖盘占据主导。
    
- 如果市场走势不确定，那么是空头获利了结和多头买盘疲软正在发生，市场很可能进入一个**交易区间**。
    
- 如果出现**强劲的向上反转**，则说明激进的多头买盘是此时最重要的因素。

>This part of the book describes many common trend patterns that you should look for every day. Although a trend can begin with any bar during the day, the majority of trend days begin within the first hour or so. If you see a trend pattern setting up within the first hour or two of the day, there will likely be several high-probability with-trend trades that you can then make.You need to decide many times every day if the day resembles any of the types of trends described later in this chapter, and if it does, force yourself to take the with-trend trades.
##### 识别每日的交易机会

---

这部分内容描述了你在日常交易中应留意的许多常见趋势形态。尽管趋势可能在一天中的任何一根K线开始，但大多数趋势日都会在**开盘后的一小时左右**形成。

如果你在开盘后的一到两小时内看到**交易机会**正在形成，那么很可能会有多个高胜率的顺势交易等待你去把握。每天你都需要多次判断当天的走势是否符合本章后续描述的任何一种趋势类型。如果符合，请强迫自己执行这些顺势交易。


>However, if none of these patterns is present, the day is a trading range day and you need to look for opportunities to fade new extremes. Also, if the market makes a run for a couple of hours and the day appears to be a trading range day, be aware that the opposite extreme might get taken out over the course of the next couple of hours, so do not be too eager to take profits on the swing portion of your reversal trade. The odds are very high that the reversal will at least test the midpoint of the day's range.
##### 交易区间日的识别与应对

---

### 交易区间日的判断与策略

然而，如果上述任何趋势形态都没有出现，那么这一天就是**交易区间日**。在这种情况下，你需要寻找**逆向交易（fade）新极点**的**交易机会**。

---

### 交易区间日内的反转交易

此外，如果市场在开盘后的几个小时内出现了一波行情，但这一天最终看起来像是交易区间日，那么请注意，**相反的极端点位在接下来的几个小时内可能会被触及**。因此，在反转交易的波段部分，不要急于获利了结。反转行情至少会测试当天交易区间中点的可能性非常高。


>After a substantial decline in a bear market on the daily chart, people begin to become very concerned about the money that they've lost and they do not want to lose any more money.This makes them sell, regardless of the fundamentals. There was an added problem in the bear market of 2008. Baby boomers were on the verge of retiring and were shocked by what they saw as comfortable nest eggs quickly falling 40 percent in value. So what will they do?They will continue to sell every rally as they try to preserve what they have left. Also, all that money that they are taking out of the market will never return to lift prices again. They will take their money at all the "Thank you, God" points along the way. This will be just below the prior swing high, where they exit and promise God that they will never buy again in return for Him letting them recoup some of their losses. This creates a series of lower highs and lows until the last bear has sold. Once that happens, the market will then be able to rally above the prior swing highs.
##### 熊市大幅下跌后的市场行为

---

### 投资者恐慌性抛售

在日线图上经历大幅下跌的熊市之后，人们开始对他们已经损失的金钱感到非常担忧，并且不愿意再损失更多。这使得他们**不顾基本面地卖出**。

---

### 2008年熊市的特殊问题与持续卖压

2008年的熊市还有一个额外的问题。婴儿潮一代正处于退休边缘，他们对自己原本舒适的“养老金”迅速缩水40%感到震惊。那么他们会怎么做呢？他们会继续**逢高卖出**，试图保住他们所剩无几的财富。

此外，他们从市场中取出的所有资金将永远不会再回来推高价格。他们会在每一个“谢天谢地”的点位离场。这通常发生在**前一个摆动高点下方**，他们在此处离场并向上帝承诺永不再买入，以换取让他们挽回部分损失。

---

### 熊市的延续与终结

这种行为会创造一系列**更低的高点和更低的低点**，直到最后一个看跌者卖出。一旦发生这种情况，市场才能突破之前的摆动高点并开始反弹。

>The result of people selling regardless of fundamentals is that the market often falls in huge bear trend days, dropping much further than what the fundamentals warrant, and often there is a huge plunge in the final 30 minutes as funds are forced to sell because of redemption orders. There will be vicious rallies along the way as people become convinced that the bottom is in and they panic to get back long. Also, because the trend is so clearly down, there will be many who are short. They may cover aggressively on any reversal, resulting in huge bull trend bars on the daily chart, even though it is still a bear market. The end result is a collection of very large range days once the bear trend is well underway. The huge ranges offer great price action day trading opportunities but you might have to increase your stop size and therefore reduce your position size. While many people following the daily charts are selling at the low and buying at the high of each trap (every strong short covering rally), trading off emotion more than reason, a good price action trader can do very well just looking for standard price action setups.
##### 熊市中的极端市场行为与交易策略

---

### 市场过度下跌与尾盘抛售

人们不顾基本面地抛售，导致市场经常出现巨大的熊市趋势日，跌幅远超基本面所能解释的程度。通常，在最后30分钟内会出现**巨幅跳水**，因为基金因赎回指令而被迫抛售。

---

### 熊市中的剧烈反弹

在此过程中，也会出现剧烈的反弹，因为人们相信底部已经形成，并恐慌性地重新做多。此外，由于趋势明显向下，会有很多人做空。他们可能会在任何反转时积极回补，导致日线图上出现巨大的牛市趋势K线，即使市场仍然处于熊市。

---

### 巨大波动范围带来的日内交易机会

最终结果是，一旦熊市趋势充分展开，会出现一系列**范围巨大的交易日**。这些巨大的范围提供了绝佳的价格行为日内**交易机会**，但您可能需要**增加止损幅度，从而减小仓位规模**。

---

### 理性交易者的优势

尽管许多关注日线图的人在每个陷阱（每一次强劲的空头回补反弹）的低点卖出、高点买入，更多是基于情绪而非理性交易，但优秀的价格行为交易者只需寻找标准的**价格行为交易机会**，就能表现出色。

>This kind of mentality is not restricted to unsophisticated investors. In the fall of 2008, most hedge funds were down on the year and their sophisticated investors aggressively pulled their money out as the market continued to sell off. The hedge funds had to continue to liquidate on every small rally to meet redemptions and anticipated redemptions. This continued to drive the market down, independent of fundamentals, and just like with less sophisticated investors, the selling will continue until all that's left are positions that investors will hold until they fall to zero.
##### 机构投资者在熊市中的行为

---

### 恐慌性赎回与被迫清算

这种恐慌心态并非仅限于不成熟的投资者。在2008年秋季，大多数对冲基金在当年都出现亏损，而其老练的投资者们随着市场持续抛售，也**积极地撤回资金**。对冲基金为了满足赎回和预期的赎回需求，不得不**在每一次小幅反弹时继续清算**。

---

### 脱离基本面的下跌

这种行为持续推动市场下跌，**独立于基本面**，就像那些经验较少的投资者一样，抛售会一直持续，直到只剩下那些投资者即使跌到零也愿意持有的头寸。


>Also, for many hedge fund managers a big part of their income is incentive based. For example, every quarter that the fund closes at a new high, they might take 20 percent of that profit above the old equity high. If the fund instead is down 30 percent on the year, it will need to earn about 50 percent to get up to that incentive level again. Rather than working for free for several years, it might make more sense to close the fund and start over with a new fund.However, when they close the fund, they have to liquidate and since there is no incentive for them, they can liquidate at any price, no matter how low. This adds to selling that is independent of the intrinsic value of stocks. If they had a $1 billion fund, their new fund is starting from scratch and it will take a few years before they have enough equity and own as much stock as they did in the old fund, so buying by the new funds doesn't immediately lift the market.
##### 基金经理激励机制对市场下跌的影响

---

### 激励机制与基金清算

此外，对于许多对冲基金经理来说，他们收入的很大一部分是**基于激励机制**的。例如，基金每季度创下新高时，他们可能会从高于旧权益高点的利润中抽取20%。如果基金当年反而下跌了30%，它需要赚取大约50%才能再次达到那个激励水平。

与其免费工作几年，**关闭基金并重新启动一个新基金可能更有意义**。然而，当他们关闭基金时，他们必须清算头寸，而且由于没有激励机制，他们可以以任何价格清算，无论多低。这加剧了**与股票内在价值无关的抛售**。

---

### 新基金对市场的影响滞后

如果他们管理着一个10亿美元的基金，他们的新基金将从零开始，需要几年时间才能积累足够的权益并拥有与旧基金相同数量的股票。因此，**新基金的买入并不会立即提振市场**。

>When the volatility reaches an extremely high level, the end of the bear trend is often near as traders give up responding to the whipsaws and decide that there is nothing left that they will sell at any price. When there are no more sellers and the market is overdone on the basis of fundamentals, a good rally should follow. And just how far can a big-name stock fall in a bear market? Much farther than you might think, even for the bluest of the blue chips. Cisco (CSCO)lost 90 percent of its value in three years after the tech wreck of 2000, and Apple (AAPL) lost 95percent of its value during the six years starting in 1991. General Motors (GM) lost 90 percent in the seven years after 2001. So don't be eager to buy just because a stock is down a Fibonacci 38 percent, 50 percent, or even 62 percent. Wait until there is a price action setup, and it must include a prior break of the bear trend line.
##### 熊市末期的特征与抄底策略

---

### 极高波动性与卖盘枯竭

当波动性达到极高水平时，熊市的结束通常临近了。此时交易者放弃对剧烈波动的反应，并决定**没有任何东西是他们愿意以任何价格出售的了**。当没有更多的卖方，并且市场根据基本面已经过度下跌时，应该会迎来一次良好的反弹。

---

### 蓝筹股的巨大跌幅

那么，一只知名股票在熊市中能跌多远呢？可能比你想象的要远得多，即使是那些最顶级的蓝筹股也不例外。例如，思科 (CSCO) 在2000年科技泡沫破裂后的三年内**损失了90%的价值**；苹果 (AAPL) 在1991年开始的六年内**损失了95%的价值**；通用汽车 (GM) 在2001年之后的七年内**损失了90%的价值**。

---

### 抄底策略的警示

因此，不要仅仅因为一只股票下跌了斐波那契的38%、50%甚至62%就急于买入。请**等待出现价格行为的交易机会**，并且这个**交易机会**必须包括**之前对熊市趋势线的突破**。
