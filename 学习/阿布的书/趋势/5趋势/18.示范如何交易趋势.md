>When the market is in a trend, traders should look for any reason to enter. The simple existence of a trend is reason enough to enter at least a small position at the market. Here are some other reasonable approaches that use stop entry orders:
>• Buying a high 2 pullback to the moving average in a bull trend.
>• Selling a low 2 pullback to the moving average in a bear trend.
>• Buying a wedge bull flag pullback in a bull trend.
>• Selling a wedge bear flag pullback in a bear trend.
>• Buying a breakout pullback after a breakout from a bull flag in a bull trend.
>• Selling a breakout pullback after a breakout from a bear flag in a bear trend.
>• Buying a high 1 pullback in a strong bull spike in a bull trend, but not after a buy climax.
>• Selling a low 1 pullback in a strong bear spike in a bear trend, but not after a sell climax.
>• When a bull trend is very strong, buying on a stop above a prior swing high.
>• When a bear trend is very strong, selling on a stop below a prior swing low.
##### 趋势交易中的入场策略

当市场处于趋势中时，交易者应该寻找任何理由入场。趋势的简单存在本身就足以让交易者至少市价入场一个小仓位。以下是一些其他使用止损入场订单的合理方法：

- 在牛市趋势中，**买入高2回调至移动平均线**。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，**卖出低2回调至移动平均线**。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，**买入楔形牛旗回调**。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，**卖出楔形熊旗回调**。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，牛旗突破后，**买入突破回调**。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，熊旗突破后，**卖出突破回调**。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，强劲的牛市急涨中，**买入高1回调**，但不要在买入高潮之后。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，强劲的熊市急涨中，**卖出低1回调**，但不要在卖出高潮之后。
    
- 当牛市趋势非常强劲时，**在前期摆动高点上方设置止损买入**。
    
- 当熊市趋势非常强劲时，**在前期摆动低点下方设置止损卖出**。

>Entering using a limit order requires more experience reading charts, because the trader is entering in a market that is going in the opposite direction to the trade. However, experienced traders can reliably use limit or market orders with these potential setups:• Buying a bull spike in a strong bull breakout at the market, at the close of every bull trend bar in the spike, or on a limit order at or below the low of the priorbar (entering in spikes requires a wider stop and the spike happens quickly, so this combination is difficult for many traders).• Selling a bear spike in a strong bear breakout at the market, at the close of every bear trend bar in the spike, or on a limit order at or above the high of the prior bar (entering in spikes is difficult for many traders).• Buying the close of the first bear bar in a bull spike.• Selling the close of the first bull bar in a bear spike.• In a bull trend, buying at a bull trend line or at a prior swing low (a potential double bottom bull flag).• In a bear trend, selling at a bear trend line or at a prior swing high (a potential double top bear flag).• Buying at or below a low 1 or 2 weak signal bar on a limit order in a possible new bull trend after a strong reversal up or at the bottom of a trading range.• Shorting at or above a high 1 or 2 weak signal bar on a limit order in a possible new bear trend after a strong reversal down or at the top of a trading range.• Buying at or below the prior bar on a limit order in a quiet bull flag at the moving average.• Shorting at or above the prior bar on a limit order in a quiet bear flag at the moving average.• Buying below a bull bar that breaks above a bull flag, anticipating a breakout pullback.• Selling above a bear bar that breaks below a bear flag, anticipating a breakout pullback.• When trying for a swing in a bull trend, buy or buy more on a breakout test, which is an attempt to run breakeven stops from an earlier long entry.• When trying for a swing in a bear trend, sell or sell more on a breakout test, which is an attempt to hit breakeven stops from an earlier short entry.• Buying at a fixed number of ticks down from the high in a bull trend. For example, buying a two-, three-, or four-point pullback in a bull trend in the Emini when the average daily range has been about 12 points. Also, if the biggest pull-back in the first couple of hours was 10ticks, buying about an eight- to 12-tick pullback.• Selling at a fixed number ticks up from the low in a bear trend. For example, selling a 50cent bear rally in GS when the average daily range has been about $2.00. If the largest pullback in the first couple of hours was 60 cents, selling about a 50 to 70 cent pullback.• Scaling into the direction of the trend as the market moves against you. If you scale in, plan out in advance what size each order has to be to keep your total risk the same as with a typical trade. It is easy to find yourself with too large a position and a protective stop that is too far away, so be very careful.• In a bull trend that has not pulled back to the moving average in 20 or more bars, buy at the moving average on a limit order, and scale in lower. For example, if there is a strong bull trend in the Emini where the market has been above the moving average for 20 or more bars, buy with a limit order at one tick above the moving average. Buy more one, two, and maybe three points lower. If scaling in, consider exiting the entire position at the first entry price, but if the bull trend is strong, look to exit on a test of the high.• In a bear trend that has not pulled back to the moving average in 20 or more bars, sell at the moving average on a limit order and scale in higher. For example, if there is a strong bear trend in the Emini where the market has been below the moving average for 20 or more bars,sell with a limit order at one tick below the moving average. Sell more one, two, and maybe three points higher. If scaling in, consider exiting the entire position at the first entry price, but if the bear trend is strong, look to exit on a test of the low.• In a strong bull trend, buy on the close of the first bear trend bar that has a close below the moving average.• In a strong bear trend, sell on the close of the first bull trend bar that has a close above the moving average.• In a strong bull trend, a pullback is a small bear trend. The bulls will expect that a breakout below a prior swing low in this small bear trend will fail, and they will buy there with a limit order.• In a strong bear trend, a pullback is a small bull trend. The bears will expect that a breakout above a prior swing high in this small bull trend will fail, and they will short there with a limit order.• A trader can always be long, short, or flat. At any moment during a trend, only two of those choices are compatible with being a successful trader. If the market is in a bull trend,successful traders are only long or flat. If it is in a bear trend, they are either short or flat. A tiny fraction of traders have the ability to consistently make money by trading against a trend, and you should assume that you are not part of that group. Unfortunately, most traders starting out go for years believing that they are, and they consistently lose money month after month and wonder why. You now know the answer.

##### 使用限价单入场的进阶策略

使用限价单入场需要更多阅读图表的经验，因为交易者是在市场朝着与交易方向相反的方向运行时入场。然而，有经验的交易者可以可靠地使用限价单或市价单进行以下潜在的**交易机会**：

- 在强劲的牛市突破中，**市价买入牛市急涨**，在急涨中每一根看涨趋势K线收盘时买入，或者以**限价单在前一根K线低点处或下方买入**（在急涨中入场需要更宽的止损，且急涨发生迅速，因此这种组合对许多交易者来说很困难）。
    
- 在强劲的熊市突破中，**市价卖出熊市急跌**，在急跌中每一根看跌趋势K线收盘时卖出，或者以**限价单在前一根K线高点处或上方卖出**（在急跌中入场对许多交易者来说很困难）。
    
- 在牛市急涨中，**买入第一根看跌K线收盘时**。
    
- 在熊市急跌中，**卖出第一根看涨K线收盘时**。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，**在看涨趋势线或前期摆动低点（潜在的双重底牛旗）买入**。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，**在看跌趋势线或前期摆动高点（潜在的双重顶熊旗）卖出**。
    
- 在强劲向上反转之后或交易区间底部，在可能的新牛市趋势中，以**限价单在弱信号K线的低1或低2位置处或下方买入**。
    
- 在强劲向下反转之后或交易区间顶部，在可能的新熊市趋势中，以**限价单在弱信号K线的高1或高2位置处或上方做空**。
    
- 在移动平均线处的平静牛旗中，以**限价单在前一根K线处或下方买入**。
    
- 在移动平均线处的平静熊旗中，以**限价单在前一根K线处或上方做空**。
    
- 在突破牛旗的看涨K线下方买入，预期会出现**突破回调**。
    
- 在突破熊旗的看跌K线上方卖出，预期会出现**突破回调**。
    
- 在牛市趋势中寻求波段交易时，在**突破测试**时买入或加仓买入，这旨在触发早期多头入场者的盈亏平衡止损。
    
- 在熊市趋势中寻求波段交易时，在**突破测试**时卖出或加仓卖出，这旨在触发早期空头入场者的盈亏平衡止损。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，在**高点下方固定点数**买入。例如，当E-mini期货的日均波动范围约为12点时，买入两点、三点或四点的牛市回调。另外，如果前两小时的最大回调是10跳动点，则买入约8到12跳动点的回调。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，在**低点上方固定点数**卖出。例如，当高盛（GS）的日均波动范围约为2.00美元时，卖出0.5美元的看跌反弹。如果前两小时的最大回调是0.6美元，则卖出约0.5到0.7美元的回调。
    
- 在市场对你不利时，**分批顺着趋势方向入场**。如果你分批入场，请提前规划好每笔订单的仓位大小，以确保总风险与典型交易保持一致。很容易出现仓位过大而保护性止损过远的情况，因此务必非常小心。
    
- 在牛市趋势中，如果市场在20根或更多K线内没有回调到移动平均线，则以**限价单在移动平均线处买入，并分批在更低点加仓**。例如，如果在E-mini期货中存在一个强劲的牛市趋势，市场已在移动平均线之上运行20根或更多K线，则以限价单在移动平均线之上一个跳动点买入。再在低一个、两个甚至三个点位买入更多。如果分批入场，可以考虑在第一次入场价格处平掉所有仓位，但如果牛市趋势强劲，则寻求在测试高点时平仓。
    
- 在熊市趋势中，如果市场在20根或更多K线内没有回调到移动平均线，则以**限价单在移动平均线处卖出，并分批在更高点加仓**。例如，如果在E-mini期货中存在一个强劲的熊市趋势，市场已在移动平均线之下运行20根或更多K线，则以限价单在移动平均线之下一个跳动点卖出。再在高一个、两个甚至三个点位卖出更多。如果分批入场，可以考虑在第一次入场价格处平掉所有仓位，但如果熊市趋势强劲，则寻求在测试低点时平仓。
    
- 在强劲的牛市趋势中，在**第一根收盘低于移动平均线的看跌趋势K线收盘时买入**。
    
- 在强劲的熊市趋势中，在**第一根收盘高于移动平均线的看涨趋势K线收盘时卖出**。
    
- 在强劲的牛市趋势中，回调是一个小型看跌趋势。多头会预期这个小型看跌趋势中对前期摆动低点的突破会失败，他们会在此处以**限价单买入**。
    
- 在强劲的熊市趋势中，回调是一个小型看涨趋势。空头会预期这个小型看涨趋势中对前期摆动高点的突破会失败，他们会在此处以**限价单做空**。
    
- 交易者可以随时做多、做空或空仓。在趋势的任何时刻，只有其中两种选择与成为成功的交易者相符。如果市场处于牛市趋势中，成功的交易者只做多或空仓。如果处于熊市趋势中，他们只做空或空仓。只有极少数交易者能够通过逆势交易持续赚钱，你应该假设自己不属于这个群体。不幸的是，大多数刚开始的交易者会多年坚信自己属于这个群体，然后月复一月地持续亏损，并疑惑原因。现在你知道答案了。

>Every type of market does something to make trading difficult. The market is filled with very smart people who are trying as hard to take money from your account as you are trying to take money from theirs, so nothing is ever easy. This includes making profits in a strong trend.When the market is trending strongly with large trend bars, the risk is great because the stop often belongs beyond the start of the spike. Also, the spike grows quickly, and many traders are so shocked by the size and speed of the breakout that they are unable to quickly reduce their position size and increase their stop size, and instead watch the trend move rapidly as they hope for a pullback. Once the trend enters its channel phase, it always looks like it is reversing. For example, in a bull trend, there will be many reversal attempts, but almost all quickly evolve into bull flags. Most bull channels will have weak buy signal bars and the signals will force bulls to buy at the top of the weak channel. This is a low probability long trade, even though the market is continuing up. Swing traders who are comfortable taking low probability buy setups near the top of weak bull channels love this kind of price action,because they can make many times what they are risking, and this more than makes up for the relatively low probability of success. However, it is difficult for most traders to buy low probability setups near the top of a weak bull channel. Traders who only want to take high probability trades often sit back and watch the trend grind higher for many bars, because there may not be a high probability entry for 20 or more bars. The result is that they see the market going up and want to be long, but miss the entire trend. They only want a high probability trade, like a high 2 pullback to the moving average. If they do not get an acceptable pullback, they will continue to wait and miss the trend. This is acceptable because traders should always stay in their comfort one. If they are only comfortable taking high probability stop entries, then they are correct in waiting. The channel will not last forever, and they will soon find acceptable setups. Experienced traders buy on limit orders around and below the lows of prior bars, and they will sometimes take some short scalps during the bull channel. Both can be high probability trades, including the shorts, if there is a strong bear reversal bar at a resistance level, and some reason to think that a pullback is imminent.

##### 市场交易的挑战与趋势交易

每种类型的市场都会制造交易的困难。市场充满了非常聪明的人，他们和你一样努力地从你的账户中赚钱，所以没有什么事情是容易的。这包括在强劲趋势中获取利润。

当市场以大型趋势K线强劲上涨时，风险是巨大的，因为止损位通常超出急涨的起点。此外，急涨迅速扩大，许多交易者对突破的大小和速度感到震惊，以至于无法迅速减小仓位并扩大止损，反而眼睁睁地看着趋势快速发展，同时希望出现回调。

一旦趋势进入其通道阶段，它总是看起来像是在反转。例如，在牛市趋势中，会有许多反转尝试，但几乎所有这些尝试都迅速演变为牛旗。大多数牛市通道都会有弱势的买入信号K线，这些信号会迫使多头在弱势通道的顶部买入。这是一个低概率的做多**交易机会**，尽管市场仍在继续上涨。

---

##### 弱势信号下的交易选择

对于那些乐于在弱势牛市通道顶部附近进行低概率买入**交易机会**的波段交易者来说，他们喜欢这种价格行为，因为他们可以获得数倍于风险的利润，这足以弥补相对较低的成功概率。然而，对于大多数交易者来说，在弱势牛市通道顶部附近买入低概率的**交易机会**是困难的。

那些只希望进行高概率交易的交易者常常会坐视市场在许多K线中缓慢上涨，因为可能在20根或更多K线内都没有高概率的入场机会。结果是，他们看到市场上涨，想要做多，却错过了整个趋势。他们只想要高概率的交易机会，比如高2回调到移动平均线。如果他们没有得到可接受的回调，他们会继续等待并错过趋势。这是可以接受的，因为交易者应该始终待在自己的舒适区内。如果他们只习惯于高概率的止损入场，那么他们的等待是正确的。通道不会永远持续，他们很快就会找到可接受的**交易机会**。

经验丰富的交易者会使用限价单在前期K线的低点附近或下方买入，他们有时也会在牛市通道中进行一些做空剥头皮交易。这两种都可能是高概率交易，包括做空，如果阻力位出现强劲的看跌反转K线，并且有理由认为回调迫在眉睫。

>With so many great ways to make money, why do most traders lose? It is because there are even more ways to make mistakes. One of the most common is that a trader begins with one plan and, once in the trade, manages it based on a different plan. For example, if a trader just lost on his past two long swing trades and now buys a third, he might be so afraid of losing again that he scalps out, only to watch the trade turn into a huge trend. Swing traders need these big wins to make up for the losses, since swing trading often is less than 50 percent successful. If traders do not hold on for the swing, they will not be getting the big wins that they need, and they will lose money. Something opposite to this can happen to scalpers. They might have taken a profitable scalp, but became sad when the trade turned into a huge trend and they watched from the sidelines. When they see another scalp, they take it, but once it reaches their profit target, they decide that the trade could turn into a swing trade, just likelast time, and they do not exit. A few minutes later, the market comes back, hits their stop, and they take a loss. This is because most scalps are high-probability trades, and when the edge is large and obvious, the move is usually small and brief, and not the start of a big swing. The best way to make money is to have a sound strategy, and then stick to the plan. For most beginning traders, the plan should be some kind of swing trade, because the winning percentage needed to be a successful scalper is much higher than most traders can maintain for the long term.

##### 大多数交易者亏损的原因：策略执行不一致

尽管有许多看似“很棒”的赚钱方式，但大多数交易者最终亏损的原因在于他们犯错的方式更多。其中最常见的一个错误是：**交易者开始时有一个计划，但一旦进入交易，就会根据另一个计划来管理它。**

举例来说，如果一个交易者在前两笔长线波段交易中都亏损了，现在买入第三笔，他可能因为害怕再次亏损而选择快速剥头皮出场，结果却眼睁睁看着这笔交易变成了一次巨大的趋势行情。波段交易者需要这些大的盈利来弥补亏损，因为波段交易的成功率通常低于50%。如果交易者没有坚持持有以完成波段交易，他们就不会获得所需的大额盈利，最终就会亏损。

---

##### 剥头皮交易者的常见误区

与此相反的情况可能发生在剥头皮交易者身上。他们可能已经进行了一笔盈利的剥头皮交易，但当交易演变为巨大的趋势行情而他们只能在一旁观望时，他们会感到沮丧。当他们看到另一次剥头皮机会时，他们抓住了，但一旦达到他们的利润目标，他们却决定这笔交易可能会像上次一样演变成波段交易，因此没有及时退出。几分钟后，市场回调，触及他们的止损，他们蒙受了损失。

这是因为大多数剥头皮交易都是高概率交易，当优势明显且巨大时，价格变动通常是小而短暂的，而不是大波段行情的开始。

---

##### 成功的关键：坚持既定策略

**赚钱的最佳方式是拥有一套健全的策略，然后坚持执行计划。** 对于大多数新手交易者来说，这个计划应该某种波段交易，因为成为一名成功的剥头皮交易者所需的胜率远高于大多数交易者长期能够维持的水平。

---

>Once traders take a position, they then have to decide how to manage it. The most important decision that they have to make is whether they are looking for a scalp or for a swing, both of which are discussed in detail in the second book, as is trade management. Only the most experienced traders should consider scalping, because the risk is sometimes greater than the potential reward. This means that they have to win about 70 percent of the time, which is impossible for anyone except an extremely good trader. You should assume that you will never be that good, because that is the reality. However, you can still be a very profitable trader. If traders are trading the Eminis at a time when the average daily range is about 10 to 15 points, they generally have to risk about two points. For example, if they are buying in a bull trend, their protective stop should be about two points below their entry price.Alternatively, their stop can be one tick below the low of the signal bar, which usually is still about two points. Some traders will risk five points or more on a swing trade if they feel confident that the trend will eventually resume. This can be a profitable approach for traders who understand the trader's equation: trade only when the chance of success times the potential reward is significantly greater than the chance of failure times the risk.
---

##### 头寸管理：剥头皮还是波段交易？

一旦交易者建立头寸，他们就必须决定如何管理它。他们需要做出的最重要决定是：**他们是在寻求剥头皮（scalp）还是波段交易（swing）**。这两者，以及交易管理，在第二本书中都有详细讨论。

只有最有经验的交易者才应该考虑剥头皮交易，因为其风险有时会大于潜在回报。这意味着他们必须赢得大约70%的时间，这对除了极其优秀的交易者之外的任何人来说都是不可能的。你应该假设你永远达不到那种水平，因为这就是现实。然而，你仍然可以成为一个非常盈利的交易者。

---

##### 剥头皮与波段交易的风险回报考量

如果交易者在E-mini期货平均日波动范围约为10到15点时进行交易，他们通常必须承担大约两点的风险。例如，如果他们在牛市趋势中买入，他们的保护性止损应该在入场价格下方大约两点。或者，他们的止损可以设在信号K线低点下方一个跳动点，这通常也大约是两点。

一些交易者如果确信趋势最终会恢复，他们可能会在波段交易中承担五点或更多的风险。这对于理解**交易者公式**的交易者来说是一种有利可图的方法：**只有当成功几率乘以潜在回报显著大于失败几率乘以风险时，才进行交易。**

---

>If a trader is scalping, then he is trying to make between one and three points on the trade.However, some scalpers think that two- and three-point trades are small swings, and consider a scalp to be a one-point trade. Although there are many trades every day where a trader can risk two points to make one point and have an 80 percent chance of success, there are many other setups that look similar but have only a 50 percent chance of success. The problem that most traders have is distinguishing between the two, and even a couple of mistakes a day can mean the difference between making money and losing money. Most traders simply cannot draw the distinction in real time, and end up losing money if they scalp. A trader who scalps only the two or three best setups a day and trades enough volume might be able to make a living as a scalper, but he might also find it difficult to watch the market for hours and be ready to quickly place a trade when one of the rare, brief setups unfolds.
---

##### 剥头皮交易的盈利目标与挑战

如果一个交易者正在进行**剥头皮交易**，那么他试图从每笔交易中赚取一到三个点。然而，一些剥头皮交易者认为两点和三点的交易是小波段，并认为剥头皮交易仅限于一个点的利润。

尽管每天都有许多交易可以冒两点风险赚取一点利润，并且有80%的成功机会，但也有许多看起来相似的**交易机会**却只有50%的成功机会。大多数交易者面临的问题是区分这两种情况，即使每天犯几个错误也可能意味着盈利和亏损之间的差异。大多数交易者根本无法实时区分，如果他们进行剥头皮交易，最终就会亏损。

---

##### 剥头皮交易的现实与难度

一个交易者如果每天只做两到三个最好的**交易机会**进行剥头皮交易，并且交易量足够大，可能能够以此为生，但他也可能会发现长时间盯盘并准备好在那些罕见而短暂的**交易机会**出现时快速下单是很困难的。

---

>The better way for beginning traders to make money is to swing their trades. They can enter all at once, or can press their trades by scaling in as the market continues in their direction.This means that they are adding to their positions as their earlier entries have growing profits.They can either exit all at once, or scale out as the trade goes their way. For example, if they buy early in a bull trend, their initial stop is two points, and they are confident that the trade will work, they should assume that the probability of success is at least 60 percent. Because of that, they should not take any profits until the trade has gone at least two points. The mathematics of trading are discussed in the second book. A trader should exit a trade only when the chance of success (here, 60 percent or higher) times the potential reward is significantly greater than the chance of failure (here, 40 percent or less) times the risk. Since the protective stop is two points below the entry price, the risk is two points. This means that the trader's equation begins to become favorable only when the reward is two points or more.Therefore, if traders take a smaller profit, they will lose money over time, unless they believe that their probability of success is about 80 percent, which is rarely the case. When it is, an experienced trader can scalp part out at a one-point profit and still make money while using a two-point stop. Most traders should never risk more than their reward.
---

##### 新手交易者的盈利之道：波段交易

对于新手交易者来说，更好的赚钱方式是进行**波段交易**。他们可以一次性全部入场，或者在市场朝着他们的方向持续发展时，通过**加仓（pressing their trades by scaling in）** 来增加头寸。这意味着当他们较早入场的头寸盈利增长时，他们会继续加仓。

他们可以一次性全部退出，或者随着交易朝着他们有利的方向发展而**分批退出（scale out）**。

---

##### 波段交易的风险与回报计算

举例来说，如果他们在牛市趋势的早期买入，初始止损是两点，并且他们确信这笔交易会成功，他们应该假设成功概率至少为60%。正因为如此，他们不应该在交易达到至少两点盈利之前就获利了结。交易的数学原理在第二本书中有讨论。

交易者应该只有在**成功几率（这里是60%或更高）乘以潜在回报显著大于失败几率（这里是40%或更低）乘以风险时**，才退出交易。由于保护性止损在入场价格下方两点，所以风险是两点。这意味着只有当回报达到两点或更多时，**交易者公式**才开始变得有利。

---

##### 避免小额利润与风险管理

因此，如果交易者获取较小的利润，他们随着时间的推移将会亏损，除非他们认为自己的成功概率约为80%（这种情况很少发生）。当这种情况发生时，经验丰富的交易者可以以一点的利润部分剥头皮出场，并且在使用两点止损的情况下仍然可以赚钱。

**大多数交易者绝不应该承担超过其潜在回报的风险。**

---


>So, how should traders swing their trades in that bull trend? This is addressed more in the second book. Swing trading is much more difficult than it appears when a trader looks at a chart at the end of the day. Swing setups tend to be either unclear or clear but scary. After a trader sees a reasonable setup, he has to take the trade. These setups almost always appear less certain than scalp setups, and the lower probability tends to make traders wait. A trend begins with a breakout either from a trading range or after a reversal of the current trend.When there is a potential reversal and it has a strong signal bar, it usually comes when the old trend is moving fast in a strong, final, climactic spike. Beginning traders invariably believe that the old trend is still in effect, and they probably lost on several earlier countertrend trades today and don't want to lose any more money. Their denial causes them to miss the early entry on the trend reversal. Entering as the breakout bar is forming, or after it closes, isdifficult to do because the breakout spike is often large, and traders have to quickly decide to risk much more than they usually do. As a result, they often end up choosing to wait for a pullback. Even if they reduce their position size so that the dollar risk is the same as with any other trade, the thought of risking two or three times as many ticks frightens them. Entering on a pullback is difficult because every pullback begins with a minor reversal, and they are concerned that the pullback might be the start of a deep correction, their stop will be hit, and they will lose money. They end up waiting until the day is almost over. When they finally decide that the trend is clear, there is no longer any time left to place a trade. Trends do everything that they can to keep traders out, which is the only way they can keep traders chasing the market all day. When a setup is easy and clear, meaning it has a high probability of success, the move is usually a small, fast scalp. If the move is going to go a long way, it has to be unclear and difficult to take, to keep traders on the sidelines and force them to chase the trend.
---

##### 波段交易的挑战与入场时机

那么，交易者应该如何在牛市趋势中进行波段交易呢？这在第二本书中有更详细的讨论。波段交易比交易者在一天结束时看图表时看起来要困难得多。波段的**交易机会**往往要么不清晰，要么清晰但令人恐惧。

在交易者看到一个合理的**交易机会**后，他必须入场。这些**交易机会**几乎总是看起来不如剥头皮交易机会那么确定，较低的概率往往使交易者选择等待。

趋势的开始通常伴随着从**交易区间**的突破，或者当前趋势的反转。当出现潜在的反转并且它具有一个强劲的信号K线时，通常发生在旧趋势以强劲、最后的、高潮式的**急涨**快速移动时。新手交易者总是认为旧趋势仍在生效，他们当天可能已经在几次早期的逆势交易中亏损，不想再亏钱了。他们的否认导致他们错过了趋势反转的早期入场机会。

---

##### 突破与回调入场的心理障碍

在突破K线形成时或收盘后入场是很困难的，因为突破的急涨通常很大，交易者必须迅速决定承担比平时多得多的风险。结果，他们常常最终选择等待回调。即使他们减少仓位大小，使得美元风险与任何其他交易相同，但冒两到三倍跳动点风险的想法仍然让他们害怕。

在回调时入场也很困难，因为每一次回调都始于一次次要反转，他们担心回调可能是深度修正的开始，他们的止损会被触及，他们会亏钱。他们最终会一直等待，直到一天快要结束。当他们最终决定趋势清晰时，已经没有时间下单了。

##### 趋势的心理操控

趋势会竭尽所能地将交易者排除在外，这是它们能够让交易者一整天都在追逐市场的唯一方式。当一个**交易机会**简单明了，意味着它具有很高的成功概率时，走势通常是一个小而快的剥头皮交易。如果走势将持续很长时间，它就必须不清晰且难以把握，以迫使交易者观望并最终追逐趋势。

>Since a bull trend has trending highs and lows, then every time the market reaches a new high, traders should raise their protective stop to one tick below the most recent low. This is called trailing their stop. Also, if their profit is large enough, they should consider taking partial profits as the market goes above the most recent high. Lots of traders do this and that is why trends often pull back after reaching a new high. The pullback very often goes below the original entry price, and inexperienced swing traders will have tightened their stops to the breakeven price and will get stopped out of a great trend trade. Once the market tests the original entry price and then goes to a new high, most traders would then raise their stops to at least their entry price because they would not want the market to come back to test it a second time after reaching a new high following the first test. Others would put it below the low of the pullback that just tested their original entry.

##### 牛市趋势中的止损追踪与利润管理

由于牛市趋势具有趋势性高点和低点，因此每当市场达到新高时，交易者都应该将他们的**保护性止损**提高到最近低点下方一个跳动点。这被称为**追踪止损**。

此外，如果他们的利润足够大，他们应该考虑在市场突破最近高点时**部分获利了结**。许多交易者这样做，这就是为什么趋势在达到新高后常常会回调。回调经常会跌破原始入场价格，而经验不足的波段交易者会把止损收紧到盈亏平衡价格，从而在一个本可以很棒的趋势交易中被止损离场。

一旦市场测试了原始入场价格并随后创出新高，大多数交易者就会将止损提高到至少其入场价格，因为他们不希望市场在第一次测试后创新高之后再次回来测试。另一些人则会将其设置在刚刚测试其原始入场价的回调低点下方。

---

>Some traders will allow pullbacks below the signal bar as long as they believe that their premise of a bull trend is still valid. For example, assume that the average range in the Eminihas been about 10 to 15 points lately, and they bought a high 2 pullback in a bull trend on the 5 minute chart. If the signal bar was two points tall, they might be willing to hold on to their position even if the market falls below the low of the signal bar, thinking that the pullback might evolve into a high 3, which is a wedge bull flag buy setup. Other traders would exit if the market falls below the signal bar and then buy again if a strong high 3 buy signal sets up.Some might even buy a position that is twice as large as their first, because they see the strong second signal as more reliable. Many of these traders would have bought just a half-size position on the high 2 buy signal if they thought that the signal did not look quite right.They were allowing for the possibility of the high 2 failing and then evolving into a wedge bull flag, which might even look stronger. If it turned out to be, they would then feel comfortable trading their usual full size.
---

##### 回调管理与分批入场策略

有些交易者会允许价格回撤到信号K线之下，只要他们认为自己的牛市趋势前提仍然有效。例如，假设E-mini期货近期平均波动范围约为10到15点，他们在5分钟图上买入了一个**牛市趋势中的高2回调**。如果信号K线高两点，他们可能愿意持有头寸，即使市场跌破信号K线的低点，他们会认为这次回调可能会演变成**高3**，这是一个**楔形牛旗买入的交易机会**。

其他交易者如果市场跌破信号K线，就会平仓退出，然后如果一个强劲的**高3买入信号**形成，他们会再次买入。有些人甚至会买入比第一次大一倍的头寸，因为他们认为强劲的第二次信号更可靠。

这些交易者中，许多人如果认为高2买入信号看起来不太对劲，他们可能只会买入半仓。他们允许高2失败并随后演变为一个可能看起来更强的**楔形牛旗**。如果最终确实如此，他们就会觉得可以放心地以常用满仓进行交易了。

---

>Other traders trade half size when they see questionable signals, exit if their protective stop is hit, and then take the second signal with a full size if the signal is strong. Traders who scale in as a trade goes against them obviously do not use the signal bar extreme for their initial protective stop, and many look to scale in exactly where other traders are taking losses on their protective stops. Some simply use a wide stop. For example, when the average daily range in the Emini is less than about 15 points, a pullback in a trend is rarely more than seven points. Some traders will consider that the trend is still in effect unless the market falls more than between 50 to 75 percent of the average daily range. As long as a pullback is within their tolerance, they will hold their position and assume that their premise is correct. If they bought a pullback in a bull trend and their entry was three points below the high of the day, then they might risk five points. Since they believe that the trend is still in effect, they believe that they have a 60 percent or better chance of an equidistant move. This means that they are at least 60 percent certain that the market will go up at least five points before falling five points to their protective stop, which creates a profitable trader's equation. If their initial buy signal in the bull pullback came at five points below the high, then they might risk just three points,and they would look to exit their long on a test of the high. Since the pull-back was relatively large, the trend might be a little weak, and this might make them take profits below the trend high. They would try to get at least as much as they had to risk, but they might be willing to get out just below the old high if they were concerned that the market might be transitioning into a trading range, or possibly even reversing into a bear trend.
---

##### 可疑信号下的交易策略与风险管理

其他交易者在看到可疑信号时会交易半仓，如果触发保护性止损就退出，然后如果第二个信号强劲，则以满仓入场。

那些在交易与他们预期方向相反时**分批入场（scale in）** 的交易者显然不会使用信号K线极端点位作为他们的初始保护性止损，许多人寻求在其他交易者因保护性止损而蒙受损失的地方 بالضبط 分批入场。有些人只是使用一个宽止损。例如，当E-mini期货的日均波动范围小于约15点时，趋势中的回调很少超过7点。一些交易者会认为，除非市场下跌超过日均波动范围的50%到75%之间，否则趋势仍然有效。只要回调在他们的容忍范围内，他们就会持有头寸并假设他们的前提是正确的。

---

##### 趋势交易中的风险回报与盈利目标

如果他们在牛市趋势中买入一个回调，并且他们的入场点位于当天高点下方三点，那么他们可能会承担五点的风险。由于他们相信趋势仍然有效，他们认为至少有60%的机会出现等距移动。这意味着他们至少有60%的把握认为市场会先上涨至少五点，然后才会下跌五点触及他们的保护性止损，这创造了一个有利可图的**交易者公式**。

如果他们在牛市回调中的初始买入信号出现在高点下方五点，那么他们可能只会承担三点的风险，他们会寻求在测试高点时平仓。由于回调相对较大，趋势可能有点弱，这可能会促使他们在趋势高点下方获利了结。他们会尽量争取至少与他们风险相同的回报，但如果他们担心市场可能正在过渡到**交易区间**，甚至可能反转为熊市趋势，他们可能会愿意在旧高点下方一点点就出场。

---

>At some point, selling pressure will be strong enough to convert the trend into a trading range,which means that a pullback might fall below the most recent low. Experienced traders have a good sense of when the market is transitioning from a trend into a trading range, and many will exit the remainder of their positions when they believe that it is about to happen. They might then trade the trading range using a trading range approach, which means looking for smaller profits. This is discussed in the second book. They might instead hold on to part of their long positions until either the close or when the market flips into always-in short. If it does, they would then either exit their longs or reverse to short. Very few traders can reverse consistently, and most prefer to exit their longs and then reassess the market, and maybe take a break before looking to go short.
---

##### 趋势向交易区间的转变与交易策略

在某个时刻，卖压会足够强劲，将趋势转变为**交易区间**，这意味着回调可能会跌破最近的低点。经验丰富的交易者对市场何时从趋势过渡到**交易区间**有很好的判断力，许多人会在他们认为即将发生这种转变时，平掉剩余的头寸。

他们之后可能会采用**交易区间**的方法进行交易，这意味着寻求较小的利润。这在第二本书中有详细讨论。

---

##### 头寸管理与反转交易的考量

他们也可能选择持有部分多头头寸，直到收盘或者市场转变为“总是看空”的状态。如果市场确实转为“总是看空”，他们就会平掉多头头寸或者反手做空。

很少有交易者能够持续成功地反手交易，大多数人更倾向于平掉多头头寸，然后重新评估市场，或者在考虑做空之前休息一下。

---

>There are countless ways to trade any day, but when there is a trend like the bull trend in GS shown in Figure 18.1, traders should try to swing at least part of their trade. I had extensive discussions years back with a trader who excelled on days like this. He bought early and then determined his initial risk (how far his protective stop was from his entry price). He then took half of his position off once the market reached twice his initial risk and held the other half until there was a clear reversal. If there never was a strong reversal, he exited in the minutes before the close. After every new high, he tightened his stop to below the most recent higher low, since as long as the trend kept making higher highs and lows, it was still strong. If it stopped making higher lows, it was beginning to weaken.
---

##### 趋势日交易：波段持仓与止损管理

交易任何一天都有无数种方法，但当出现像图18.1中高盛（GS）所示的牛市趋势时，交易者应该尝试**波段持有**至少一部分仓位。

多年前，我曾与一位在这种日子里表现出色的交易者进行过深入讨论。他早早买入，然后确定他的初始风险（即他的保护性止损距离其入场价格有多远）。随后，一旦市场达到他初始风险的两倍，他会平掉一半仓位，并持有另一半直到出现明确的反转。如果从未出现强劲反转，他会在收盘前几分钟平仓。

每当创出新高后，他都会将止损收紧到最近的更高低点之下，因为只要趋势持续创出更高高点和低点，它就仍然强劲。如果停止创出更高低点，则表明趋势开始走弱。

>There is one sure way to consistently lose money on a day like this, and all traders know it.Successful traders avoid it, but beginners are irresistibly drawn to it. They see the market as constantly overdone. The most recent bar is always at the top of the computer screen and there surely can't be enough room up there to go higher, and there clearly is a lot of room below. Also, they know trends have pull-backs, so why not short every reversal for a scalp, and then go long on the pullback? Even if the trade is a loser, the loss is not big. They don't buy the pullback when it finally comes, because the market might be reversing into a bear trend, and the buy setup does not look strong enough. Also, since they were short and the market did not quite reach their scalper's profit target, they were rooting for the market to godown just a little bit more, and therefore were not expecting, and actually not wanting, the pullback to end just yet. They saw bars 7, 10, 18, 20, 21, and 24 as reversals that were likely to fall far enough to offer at least a scalper's profit and as potential highs of the day. However,experienced traders know that 80 percent of reversal attempts fail and become bull flags, and they held long, took some profits on their earlier longs, or bought more as the pullback progressed. The beginners don't accept this premise and they take small losses all day, and by the end of the day are shocked that they have lost so much. They have been successful all their lives in other careers and are very smart. They see trading gurus on television who look more like clowns and used car salesmen than like formidable adversaries, so they are confident that they can trade at least as well as those so-called experts. They are right in their assessment of the abilities of those pundits, but wrong in their assumption that those people are successful traders. They are entertainers, and the networks hire them to create an audience that will result in advertising dollars. The networks are companies, and like all companies, their goal is to make money, not to help the viewer in any way. Beginners do not stop losing until they are able to stop themselves from looking for shorts in bull trends (or bottoms in bear trends). They can start winning only when they accept that each top is the start of a bull flag.

##### 趋势日亏损的根源：逆势交易的诱惑

在像这样的日子里，有一种肯定会持续亏损的方法，所有交易者都知道这一点。成功的交易者会避免它，但初学者却无法抗拒地被它吸引。他们认为市场总是“过度了”。最新的K线总是在屏幕顶部，肯定没有足够的空间再往上涨了，而且下方显然有很大的下跌空间。此外，他们知道趋势会有回调，那为什么不每次反转都做空剥头皮，然后又在回调时做多呢？即使交易亏损，损失也不大。

当回调最终到来时，他们却不买入，因为市场可能正在反转进入熊市趋势，而且买入**交易机会**看起来不够强劲。而且，由于他们之前做空，市场没有完全达到他们剥头皮交易的利润目标，他们一直希望市场能再跌一点点，因此他们没有预期，实际上也不希望回调现在就结束。

---

##### 错误判断反转与趋势延续

他们将第7、10、18、20、21和24根K线视为可能跌到足以提供至少一个剥头皮利润的反转点，并视为当天的潜在高点。然而，经验丰富的交易者知道，**80%的反转尝试都会失败并演变为牛旗**，他们会继续持有做多头寸，或者在回调过程中对早期多头头寸进行部分获利了结，或者进一步买入。

初学者不接受这个前提，他们整天都在遭受小额亏损，到一天结束时，他们惊讶于自己亏损了这么多。他们在其他职业中一生都取得了成功，而且非常聪明。他们看到电视上的交易“大师”看起来更像是小丑和二手车推销员，而不是强大的对手，因此他们自信地认为自己至少能和那些所谓的专家一样进行交易。他们对这些“专家”的能力评估是正确的，但对这些人是成功交易者的假设是错误的。他们是艺人，电视台雇佣他们是为了吸引观众以获得广告费。电视台是公司，和所有公司一样，他们的目标是赚钱，而不是以任何方式帮助观众。

---

##### 停止亏损的关键认知转变

初学者只有当他们能够**停止在牛市趋势中寻找做空机会（或在熊市趋势中寻找底部）时，才能停止亏损。** 他们只有当接受每一个顶部都是牛旗的开始时，才能开始盈利。

>Some of the material that follows will be covered later in books 2 and 3, and is included here because it is important in trend trading.
---

##### 趋势交易中的重要补充材料

以下一些材料将在第二本书和第三本书中进行更深入的探讨，但此处也将其纳入，因为它们在**趋势交易**中非常重要。

---

>Great swings usually begin with weak setups, like the two-bar reversal that began at bar 3.Both bars were small dojis, and they followed a large two-bar reversal top. The setup that leads to the breakout is usually weak enough to trap traders out. Traders wait for a higher-probability setup after the breakout occurs, and miss the initial breakout. Entering either on the low-probability setup or on the higher-probability ones after the breakout are both mathematically sound approaches.
---

##### 大幅摆动的启动与信号K线

通常，大幅度的**摆动（swings）** 开始于弱势的**交易机会**，例如在第3根K线开始的两K线反转。这两根K线都是小型的十字星K线，并且它们紧随一个大型的两K线反转顶部之后。

导致突破的**交易机会**通常弱到足以将交易者“困”在场外。交易者会等待突破发生后更高概率的**交易机会**，从而错过了最初的突破。

无论是入场低概率的**交易机会**，还是在突破发生后入场高概率的**交易机会**，从数学上讲，都是合理的。

---

>Most traders would have decided that the always-in direction was up by either bar 2 or bar 4.That means that they believed that the market was in a bull trend and they therefore would look for sensible reasons to buy, and there were many. They could have bought as bar 4 broke above bar 2, on the close of bar 4, or at one tick above its high. They could have placed a limit order to buy at or below the low of the next bar and the lows of the next several bars. They would have been filled below bar 5. Some would have placed orders to buy a small pullback to the midpoint of the prior bar, maybe 20 cents down. They also would have looked to buy a bear close because they believed that attempts to reverse should fail. The move from bar 4 to bar 5 was a tight channel, so an attempt to break to the downside was likely to fail. They could have bought below bar 5, on the close of the small bear trend bar that followed, or above it as a failed breakout below a bull micro channel. Bar 7 was a breakout pullback short but traders expected it to just lead to a pullback. The market broke below the bull micro channel on the move below bar 5, and the rally to bar 7 was a breakout pullback higher high. Traders expected the reversal to fail and some had limit orders maybe 50 cents down and in the area of the bar 6 low, expecting a double bottom bull flag. Some traders had their protective stops below bar 6 since it was a strong bull trend bar, and a strong bull trend usually would not fall below such a bar. Therefore, buying just above its low was a low-risk, high-reward trade with at least a 50 percent chance of success. They also could have bought above the bull reversal bar that followed bar 8 since it was a double bottom bull flag setup and a high 2 long (bar 6was the high 1).
---

##### 牛市趋势中的入场策略选择

大多数交易者在第2根或第4根K线时就会判定市场处于“总是做多”的方向。这意味着他们相信市场处于**牛市趋势**中，因此他们会寻找合理的买入理由，而这样的理由有很多。

他们可以在第4根K线突破第2根K线时买入，在第4根K线收盘时买入，或者在其高点上方一个跳动点买入。他们可以在下一根K线和接下来的几根K线低点处或下方设置限价买单。他们的订单会在第5根K线下方成交。有些人会设置订单买入回调到前一根K线中点的小幅回撤，也许是下跌20美分。他们也会寻求买入看跌收盘价，因为他们相信反转尝试应该会失败。

---

##### 紧密通道与失败突破的交易机会

从第4根K线到第5根K线的走势是一个**紧密通道**，因此向下突破的尝试很可能会失败。他们可以在第5根K线下方买入，在随后出现的小型看跌趋势K线收盘时买入，或者在其上方买入，将其视为看涨微型通道的失败突破。

第7根K线是一个**突破回调做空交易机会**，但交易者预期它只会导致一次回调。市场在跌破第5根K线后跌破了看涨微型通道，而反弹至第7根K线是一个突破回调的更高高点。交易者预期反转会失败，有些人设置了限价单，可能在下方50美分，并且在第6根K线低点附近，预期会出现**双重底牛旗**。

---

##### 强劲趋势中的止损设置与高回报交易机会

一些交易者将保护性止损设置在第6根K线下方，因为这是一根强劲的看涨趋势K线，而强劲的牛市趋势通常不会跌破这样的K线。因此，在其低点上方一点点买入是一种**低风险、高回报的交易**，成功几率至少有50%。

他们也可以在第8根K线之后出现的看涨反转K线上方买入，因为它是一个**双重底牛旗的交易机会**，也是一个**高2做多交易机会**（第6根K线是高1）。

---

>Bar 9 was another break below a bull micro channel, and traders expected it to fail. Some would have had limit orders to buy at the low of the prior bar as the micro channel was growing, and they would have been filled on bar 9. Other traders bought above the bar 9 high as a failed breakout below the bull micro channel.
---

##### 牛市微型通道的失败突破与买入机会

第9根K线是另一个跌破牛市微型通道的走势，交易者预期它会失败。一些交易者在微型通道形成过程中，会在前一根K线的低点处设置限价买单，然后在第9根K线处成交。其他交易者则在第9根K线高点上方买入，将其视为跌破牛市微型通道的失败突破**交易机会**。

---

>Bar 11 was another high 2 buy setup, but the market had been mostly sideways for over 10bars, and the bars were getting small. Although this was also a double bottom buy signal, the tight trading range could have continued, so many traders would have waited to see if there was a third push down and then looked to buy above the wedge bull flag, which some traders would have seen as a triangle, since it would have been sideways instead of down. These traders got long on bar 12 and above bar 12. After the breakout from this bull flag, the market went sideways for several bars and created a breakout pullback buy entry above bar 13 and again on the bar 14 outside up strong bull trend bar. This was a high 2 entry bar since bar 13was a high 1 entry and the pullback below the next bar was a second leg down in this four-bar-long tight trading range.
---

##### 横盘整理中的高2买入与突破回调

第11根K线是另一个**高2买入交易机会**，但市场已经横盘整理了超过10根K线，并且K线实体越来越小。尽管这同时也是一个**双重底买入信号**，但紧密的**交易区间**可能还会继续，因此许多交易者会等待是否出现第三次下跌推动，然后寻求在**楔形牛旗**上方买入，一些交易者可能将其视为**三角形**，因为它更偏横盘而非下跌。这些交易者在第12根K线以及第12根K线上方做多入场。

---

##### 牛旗突破后的交易机会

在这个牛旗突破后，市场横盘整理了几根K线，并在第13根K线上方，以及第14根外包向上强劲看涨趋势K线上，创建了一个**突破回调买入入场机会**。这是**高2入场K线**，因为第13根K线是高1入场，而下一根K线下方回调是这个四K线长的紧密交易区间中的第二段下跌。

---

>Some traders bought as the market broke above bar 10, which they saw as a breakout of a trading range in a bull trend. Traders also bought the close of bar 14 and above its high. The next bar had good follow-through, which was a sign of strength, and traders therefore bought its close and above its high. There was a two-bar pause, creating a small breakout pullback bull flag, and traders bought the breakout above the bar after bar 15.
---

##### 突破交易与后续动量确认

一些交易者在市场突破第10根K线时买入，他们将其视为牛市趋势中**交易区间**的突破。

交易者也在第14根K线收盘时及其高点上方买入。下一根K线有很好的**跟进动量**，这是一个强势的信号，因此交易者在其收盘时和高点上方买入。

随后出现了两根K线的停顿，形成了一个小型**突破回调牛旗**，交易者在第15根K线之后的K线上方突破时买入。

---

>Bar 16 was a doji top but there was no prior bear strength and no significant selling pressure,and the bar was small and weak compared to the bar 14 bull spike. Traders expected the reversal attempt to fail and therefore placed limit orders to buy at and below its low. Bar 17was a failed top buy signal, and bar 19 was a small second push down and therefore a high 2buy setup. Traders bought as the market went above its high and above the high of the bull bar that followed it, which was a two-bar reversal buy setup.
---

##### 弱势反转信号下的买入策略

第16根K线是一个十字星顶部，但之前没有看跌的**动量**，也没有明显的卖压，而且与第14根K线的牛市急涨相比，这根K线很小且弱势。交易者预期这次反转尝试会失败，因此在第16根K线的低点处或下方设置了限价买单。

第17根K线是一个失败的顶部买入信号，而第19根K线是一个小型第二次下跌推动，因此是一个**高2买入交易机会**。交易者在市场突破其高点以及其后面那根看涨K线的高点时买入，这构成了一个**两K线反转买入交易机会**。

---

>The move up to bar 20 was another strong bull spike. Traders would have bought at and below the low of the prior bar, on the close of the bull trend bars, and on the close of the first bear trend bar, like the bar after bar 20. Since bar 20 was an especially large bull trend bar in a mature trend, it was enough of a buy climax to warrant a larger correction, one that might go sideways or down to the moving average. There was less urgency for the bulls, who were expecting a high 2 or a triangle.
---

##### 强劲牛市急涨后的交易与调整

向上运动到第20根K线是又一次强劲的**牛市急涨**。交易者会选择在前一根K线的低点处或下方买入，在看涨趋势K线收盘时买入，以及在第一根看跌趋势K线收盘时买入，就像第20根K线之后的K线一样。

由于第20根K线在成熟趋势中是一根尤其大的看涨趋势K线，它足以构成一次买入高潮，需要一次更大的修正，这次修正可能会横盘或下跌到移动平均线。多头感到不那么紧迫了，他们预期会出现**高2**或**三角形**的**交易机会**。

---


>Bar 21 was a one-bar final flag reversal attempt but the up momentum was strong. Traders expected another bull flag and not a reversal. Some bought below its low while others waited to see if there would be a high 2, a wedge bull flag, or a triangle. Bar 22 was another double bottom and therefore a high 2 buy setup. Traders placed stop orders to go long above its high and above the high of the inside bar that followed it. Some saw bar 23 as a high 2 buy setup with the bar after bar 20 as the signal for the high  1. Others saw it as a wedge bull flag with the first push down as the bear bar after bar 20. It was also a breakout pullback buy setup for the breakout above the bull flag that occurred on the prior bar.
---

##### 牛市动量下的反转尝试与买入机会

第21根K线是**单K线最终旗形反转尝试**，但向上的**动量**依然强劲。交易者预期会出现另一个**牛旗**，而不是反转。一些人在其低点下方买入，而另一些人则等待，看是否会出现**高2**、**楔形牛旗**或**三角形**的**交易机会**。

第22根K线是另一个**双重底**，因此是一个**高2买入交易机会**。交易者在它的高点上方以及它之后内包K线的高点上方设置了止损买单。

一些人将第23根K线视为**高2买入交易机会**，而将第20根K线之后的K线视为**高1的信号**。另一些人则将其视为**楔形牛旗**，其中第20根K线之后的看跌K线是第一次下跌推动。它也是一个**突破回调买入的交易机会**，因为前一根K线已经突破了牛旗。

---

>Bar 24 was a very important bar. It was the third push up and third consecutive buy climax after the spike up from bar 14 (the top of the spike was the first push). The channel in a spike and channel bull often ends on a third push up and is then followed by a correction. Also, bar 24 was a particularly strong bull trend bar in a protracted bull trend. This is just the bar that strong bulls and bears were waiting for. Both saw it as a possible temporary end of the trend,and they expected it to be a brief opportunity to sell before a larger pullback developed. Both expected a correction to have at least two legs and 10 bars and to penetrate the moving average. The bulls were selling to take profits and the bears were selling to initiate shorts.Both sold at the close of bar 24, above its high, at the close of the next bar, and below its low.
---

##### 第24根K线：趋势尾声与反转预期

第24根K线是非常重要的一根K线。它是从第14根K线急涨以来的第三次向上推动，也是第三个连续的**买入高潮**（急涨的顶部是第一次推动）。**急涨通道型牛市（spike and channel bull）** 中的通道通常在第三次向上推动后结束，随后会伴随着一次修正。

此外，第24根K线在一段持久的牛市趋势中，是一根特别强劲的看涨趋势K线。这正是强劲的多头和空头一直在等待的K线。双方都认为这可能是趋势的暂时性结束，他们预计这将是一个短暂的卖出机会，之后会形成更大的回调。双方都预期修正至少会有两“腿”和10根K线，并会穿透移动平均线。

多头卖出是为了获利了结，而空头卖出是为了建立空头头寸。双方都在第24根K线收盘时、其高点上方、下一根K线收盘时以及其低点下方进行卖出操作。

---

>The bulls thought that the market might be transitioning into a trading range, and that there was a reasonable chance that they could buy again lower. Bar 28 was a two-legged correction to the moving average and therefore a high 2 buy setup. It was also the first touch of the moving average all day, and therefore a 20 gap bar buy setup, and was likely to be followed by a test of the bull high. The bears took profits on their shorts here and the bulls bought for another leg up.
---

##### 市场预期与看涨交易机会

多头认为市场可能正在向**交易区间**过渡，并且有相当大的机会在更低的位置再次买入。

第28根K线是**两段式回调**至移动平均线，因此是一个**高2买入交易机会**。这也是当天首次触及移动平均线，因此也是一个**20缺口K线买入交易机会**，并且很可能随后会测试牛市高点。

空头在此处对他们的空头头寸进行了获利了结，而多头则买入以期待价格再次上涨一“腿”。

---

>The biggest prior pullback of the day since the rally began at bar 3 was 75 cents on the pullback to bar 8. Some traders expected the largest pullback of the day to come after 11:00a.m. or so and therefore had limit orders to go long at 75 cents below the most recent swing high. They might have scaled in at 75 cents below that and maybe risked up to a little more than twice the size of that first pullback, or about $1.60. Throughout the day, traders would have expected pullbacks to remain less than the first and they would have had limit orders to buy any pullback that was about half as big, or maybe 40 to 50 cents. The pullback to bar 11was 40 cents, which meant that traders tried to buy a 50 cent pullback and when they did not get filled on the second attempt on the bar before bar 12, they decided to chase the market up and bought above the high of bar 12. Some traders saw the bars 9 and 11 double bottom and would have placed limit orders to buy just above its low, maybe 30 cents down from the high.Traders would then have to determine where a worst-case protective stop would be. They should pick a level where they would no longer want to be long. An obvious location would have been below the bar 8 low, since a bull trend has a series of higher highs and lows, and after each new high, the bulls expect the next pullback to stay above the most recent higher low. Since they were planning to get long at $161.05, 30 cents down from the high, and they would need to risk to around $160.35 or 70 cents lower, they had to determine the position size. If they normally risk $500 or less on a trade, they could have bought 600 shares of GS.Since they were risking 70 cents and they always should have a reward that is at least as large as their risk, their profit target should have been at least 70 cents above their entry. This was clearly a strong trend day at this point and the probability of success was therefore at least 60percent, and maybe higher.

##### 回调预判与限价单入场

自第3根K线开始上涨以来，当日最大的回调是到第8根K线的回调，幅度为75美分。一些交易者预计当天最大的回调会在上午11点左右出现，因此他们设置了**限价买单**，在最近的摆动高点下方75美分处做多。他们可能会在那个点位下方75美分处分批加仓，并可能承担高达第一次回调幅度两倍多一点的风险，大约1.60美元。

全天，交易者会预期回调幅度会保持小于第一次回调，他们会设置限价买单，买入任何大约一半大小（约40到50美分）的回调。到第11根K线的回调是40美分，这意味着交易者试图买入50美分的回调，当他们在第12根K线之前的那根K线第二次尝试时未能成交，他们决定追涨并买入第12根K线高点上方。一些交易者看到了第9根和第11根K线的**双重底**，并会设置限价买单，就在其低点上方，可能比高点低30美分。

---

##### 止损设定与仓位管理

交易者随后必须确定最坏情况下的保护性止损位置。他们应该选择一个他们不再想做多的水平。一个明显的位置是在第8根K线低点下方，因为牛市趋势有一系列更高的高点和低点，在每个新高之后，多头都期望下一次回调能保持在最近的更高低点之上。

由于他们计划在161.05美元处做多，比高点低30美分，并且他们需要承担大约160.35美元或更低70美分的风险，他们必须确定仓位大小。如果他们通常每笔交易的风险为500美元或更少，他们可以买入600股高盛股票。由于他们承担70美分的风险，并且回报应该至少与风险一样大，所以他们的利润目标应该至少比他们的入场价高70美分。

在这一点上，这显然是一个强劲的趋势日，因此成功概率至少为60%，甚至更高。

>On a strong trend day like this, it was far better to use a generous profit target. Traders should not have tried to take any profit until the market went to at least twice their risk, or $1.40above their entry price. They would have placed a limit order to sell half of their position at $162.45. After the bar 12 strong bull trend bar broke above the triangle (some thought of it as a wedge bull flag), they could have tightened their protective stop to just below its low at $161.05, reducing their risk to less than 20 cents. After the bar 14 strong bull trend bar breakout, they could have tightened their stop to just below its low, reducing their risk to a penny. Their limit order to take profits on 300 shares would have been filled on bar 20, giving them $420. At that point, they could have tightened their protective stop to below the bar 19start of that most recent bull spike. If the stop was hit, they would have made about 80 cents on their remaining 300 shares. At this point, they would have held their position until there was a clear reversal down or until the close. When you have a large profit, it is usually wise to exit in the final hour or so on any setup that could lead to a larger pullback and then maybe look to get long again once that two-legged pullback is complete. The bear reversal bar at bar 24 was a third push up and was followed a buy climax bar, so the market could finally have been getting ready to pull back to the moving average. If traders exited below its low, they would have made $2.00, or $600, on their remaining 300 shares. If they held until the close,they would have made $375 on those shares. The market never even clearly became always-in short.

##### 强趋势日下的盈利策略与止损管理

在像这样的强劲趋势日，最好使用一个**宽裕的利润目标**。交易者不应该在市场达到其风险的两倍（即入场价格上方1.40美元）之前就尝试获利了结。他们本可以在162.45美元处设置限价单，卖出他们一半的仓位。

在第12根强劲看涨趋势K线突破三角形（一些人认为它是楔形牛旗）之后，他们本可以将其保护性止损收紧至其低点161.05美元下方，将风险降低到不足20美分。在第14根强劲看涨趋势K线突破后，他们本可以将其止损收紧至其低点下方，将风险降至一美分。

---

##### 利润兑现与后续操作

他们卖出300股的限价单本应在第20根K线成交，为他们带来420美元的利润。此时，他们本可以将其保护性止损收紧至第19根K线（最近一次牛市急涨的起点）的下方。如果止损被触发，他们剩余的300股股票本可以盈利约80美分。

在这一点上，他们会持有头寸直到出现明确的下跌反转或直到收盘。当您有可观的利润时，通常明智的做法是在最后大约一小时内，在任何可能导致更大回调的**交易机会**出现时平仓，然后可能在两段式回调完成后再次做多。

第24根K线的看跌反转K线是第三次上涨推动，随后是**买入高潮K线**，因此市场可能最终准备回调至移动平均线。如果交易者在其低点下方退出，他们剩余的300股股票将盈利2.00美元，即600美元。如果他们持有到收盘，这些股票将盈利375美元。市场甚至从未明确转变为“总是看空”。

>Many traders would have bought on a limit order at one tick above the moving average as bar 27 tested the moving average, since it was a 20 gap bar buy setup, and held for a test of the high. Some traders would have bought on the close of bar 27 because it was the first bear trend bar with a close below the moving average. Although it was the second bar of a two-bar bear spike and a breakout below bar 25, the bears needed follow-through before believing that the market had flipped to always-in short, and instead got a bull inside bar for the next bar. This was the bottom of a developing trading range and the test of the beginning of the channel up from the bar 22 pullback from the four-bar bull spike up to bar 20. The bull bar that followed bar 27 also closed above the moving average. Some bulls would have bought on the close of that bull bar, while others would have bought at one tick above its high. Their entry would have been three bars later. Traders would also have bought above the high of the inside bar that followed bar 28, since it was a high 2 buy signal, ending two legs down from the high of the day. It was also a small wedge bull flag where bar 25 was the first push down and bar 27 was the second.
---

##### 移动平均线测试与买入机会

许多交易者在第27根K线测试移动平均线时，会以**限价单在移动平均线上方一个跳动点买入**，因为这是一个**20缺口K线买入交易机会**，并会持有以测试高点。

一些交易者会在第27根K线收盘时买入，因为这是第一根收盘低于移动平均线的看跌趋势K线。尽管它是两K线看跌急跌的第二根K线，并且跌破了第25根K线，但空头需要**跟进动量**才能相信市场已经转变为“总是做空”，结果却在下一根K线看到了一根看涨内包K线。这是正在形成的**交易区间**的底部，也是从第22根K线回调（从四K线牛市急涨到第20根K线）开始的通道的测试。

---

##### 突破与形态中的买入策略

第27根K线之后的那根看涨K线也收盘在移动平均线之上。一些多头会在那根看涨K线收盘时买入，而另一些人则会在其高点上方一个跳动点买入。他们的入场会在三根K线之后。

交易者也会在第28根K线之后出现的内包K线高点上方买入，因为它是一个**高2买入信号**，结束了当日高点以来的两段式下跌。它也是一个小型**楔形牛旗**，其中第25根K线是第一次下跌推动，第27根K线是第二次。

---

>A pullback is a minor trend in the opposite direction, and traders expect it to end soon and for the major trend to resume. When GS began its second leg down from the bar 24 high, it formed a lower high at bar 26 and the bears needed it to form a series of lower highs and lows to be able to convince the market that the trend had reversed to down. Some therefore shorted as the market broke out below the bar 25 swing low, hoping for a series of large bear trend bars. Instead, bar 25 was a small bear trend bar and there was no follow-through. In fact,the rally up showed that most traders instead bought the breakout below bar 25 because they believed that the sell-off was only a pullback and doomed to be a failed attempt at reversing the major trend into a bear trend. Since most reversal attempts fail, the first pullback in a strong bull trend that has a second leg down usually is bought aggressively as it breaks below the prior swing low, and many bulls bought this one, even though it took several bars before they could turn the market up again. This was a sign that they were not as aggressive as they could have been. This told traders that the pullback might evolve into a larger trading range,which it ultimately did.
---

##### 回调：主要趋势中的次要反向趋势

**回调**是主要趋势中次要的反向趋势，交易者预期它很快就会结束，然后主要趋势会恢复。当高盛（GS）从第24根K线高点开始其第二段下跌时，它在第26根K线形成了一个更低的高点，空头需要它形成一系列更低的高点和低点才能说服市场趋势已经反转向下。因此，一些交易者在市场跌破第25根K线摆动低点时做空，希望能出现一系列大型看跌趋势K线。

---

##### 突破失败与市场信心

然而，第25根K线却是一个小型看跌趋势K线，并没有出现**跟进动量**。事实上，随后的反弹表明，大多数交易者反而买入了跌破第25根K线的突破，因为他们相信这次抛售仅仅是一次回调，注定是反转主要趋势为熊市趋势的失败尝试。

由于大多数反转尝试都会失败，强劲牛市趋势中出现第二段下跌的第一次回调，通常在跌破前期摆动低点时会遭到积极买入。许多多头买入了这次回调，尽管他们花了数根K线才再次将市场推高。这表明他们的积极性不如预期。这告诉交易者，这次回调可能会演变成一个更大的**交易区间**，而最终它也确实如此。

---

>Many traders use trend lines for entering and exiting. Some would have taken partial profits near the high of bar 7 as it moved above the trend channel line. They also would have bought as bar 9 fell below the bull trend line and above the bar 9 high, since they saw bar 9 as a failed channel breakout. Bar 12 broke above a small bear trend line, and traders bought as the bar moved above the line since they saw that as the end of the pullback and the resumption of the bull trend. Bar 24 was the third push up in the channel that followed the two-bar bull spike that began at bar 14, and some traders would take profits on their longs above that line, even on the strong bull close of bar 24. The bar was an especially large bull trend bar and the third consecutive bull climax since bar 14, and the market was likely to have a more complex correction. What better place to take profits than on a buy vacuum test of a trend channel line on the third consecutive buy climax? The move down to bar 28 broke below the bull trend line and held below it for many bars, so traders wondered if a larger correction might be starting.This made many quicker to take profits. When the move up from bar 28 could not produce any strong bull trend bars, traders thought that the market might be in a trading range and therefore took profits on the bar 29 test of the bar 26 lower high. This was a potential double top bear flag and lower high trend reversal. The next bar was a bear trend bar, which indicated that the bulls were becoming less aggressive and the bears were becoming stronger.
---

##### 趋势线在交易中的应用

许多交易者使用**趋势线**进行入场和出场。一些交易者会在第7根K线高点附近，当它突破趋势通道线时，选择**部分获利了结**。他们也会在第9根K线跌破看涨趋势线并突破第9根K线高点时买入，因为他们将第9根K线视为失败的通道突破。

第12根K线突破了一根小型看跌趋势线，交易者在这根K线突破趋势线时买入，因为他们认为这是回调的结束和牛市趋势的恢复。

---

##### 趋势通道线与买入高潮的获利了结

第24根K线是继第14根K线开始的两K线牛市急涨之后，通道中的第三次上涨推动。一些交易者会在这条线上方获利了结他们的多头仓位，即使第24根K线收盘强劲看涨。这根K线是一根尤其大的看涨趋势K线，也是自第14根K线以来的第三个连续买入高潮，市场很可能会出现更复杂的修正。有什么比在趋势通道线上的买入真空测试（buy vacuum test）且是第三个连续买入高潮时获利了结更好的时机呢？

---

##### 趋势线跌破与交易区间转换

跌至第28根K线的走势跌破了看涨趋势线，并在此下方持续多根K线，这让交易者怀疑是否正在开始一次更大的修正。这使得许多交易者更快地获利了结。

当从第28根K线开始的上涨未能产生任何强劲的看涨趋势K线时，交易者认为市场可能处于**交易区间**中，因此在第29根K线测试第26根K线的更低高点时获利了结。这是一个潜在的**双重顶熊旗**和更低高点趋势反转的**交易机会**。下一根K线是一根看跌趋势K线，这表明多头正在变得不那么激进，而空头正在变得更强。

>When a bull trend is very strong, traders can buy for any reason if they use a wide enough stop, and many traders like to buy on breakouts above prior swing highs. However, buying pullbacks before the breakout generally offers more reward, smaller risk, and a higher probability of success. The breakout traders will place buy stops at one tick above the old high and will be swept into their longs as the market breaks above the old high. The most common reason for traders failing to buy a pullback is that they were hoping for a larger or better-looking pull-back. Many pullbacks have bear signal bars or follow two or three bar bear spikes, making traders believe that the bull trend needs to correct more before resuming.However, it is important to get long when there is a strong bull trend, and a trader should place a buy stop above the prior swing high when the trend is very strong, in case the pullback is brief and the trend quickly resumes. Reasonable entries included the bar 4 breakout above the bar 2 high and the breakouts up to bar 10 as it moved above bar 7, the bar 14 spike as it went above bar 10, and the bar 20 spike as it moved above bar 16. These old highs are often the highs of higher time frame bars, like on the 15 or 60 minute charts, so the entry is usually a breakout above the high of a prior bull trend bar on these higher time frame charts. Since higher time frame charts have larger bars and the protective stop is initially below the signal bar, the risk is greater and traders should trade smaller size, unless they are only looking for a quick, small scalp. After the trend has gone on for a while, the pull-backs become deeper and last for more bars. Once the two-sided trading becomes apparent, the strong bulls begin to take profits above swing highs rather than buying new positions, and the strong bears begin to scale into shorts as the market goes above the old highs. For example, the bear bar after bar 20 and the bar 22 bear bar were signs of selling pressure, so most traders would have used the move above the bar 21 high to take profits rather than to buy more. At some point, most traders will see new highs as shorting opportunities and not simply as areas to take profits.Although many traders shorted below the bear bar after bar 24, most traders still believed that the trend was up and that there would be a test of the bull high after a pullback. Until there has been a strong bear move that breaks well below the bull trend line, the strong bears usually will not dominate the market.

##### 强势牛市趋势下的交易机会

当牛市趋势非常强劲时，交易者可以出于任何原因买入，只要他们使用足够宽的止损。许多交易者喜欢在突破前期摆动高点时买入。然而，在突破之前买入回调通常能提供更多的**回报**、更小的**风险**和更高的**成功概率**。

突破交易者会在旧高点上方一个跳动点设置买入止损单，当市场突破旧高点时，他们就会被带入多头头寸。交易者未能买入回调的最常见原因是他们希望出现更大或更好看的回调。许多回调有看跌信号K线或伴随两三根K线的看跌急跌，这让交易者认为牛市趋势需要更多修正才能恢复。然而，在牛市趋势强劲时进行多头交易很重要，交易者应该在趋势非常强劲时，在前期摆动高点上方设置买入止损，以防回调短暂，趋势迅速恢复。

合理的入场**交易机会**包括：第4根K线突破第2根K线高点，以及上涨至第10根K线突破第7根K线高点，第14根K线急涨突破第10根K线高点，以及第20根K线急涨突破第16根K线高点。这些旧高点通常是更高时间框架（如15分钟或60分钟图表）K线的高点，因此入场通常是这些更高时间框架图表上前期看涨趋势K线高点的突破。由于更高时间框架图表K线更大，且保护性止损最初设在信号K线下方，所以风险更大，交易者应该交易更小的仓位，除非他们只寻求快速、小额的剥头皮交易。

---

##### 趋势后期与利润管理

当趋势持续一段时间后，回调会变得更深，并持续更多K线。一旦双向交易变得明显，强势的多头开始在摆动高点上方获利了结，而不是买入新头寸；强势的空头开始在市场突破旧高点时**分批做空**。例如，第20根K线之后的看跌K线和第22根看跌K线都是卖压的迹象，因此大多数交易者会利用突破第21根K线高点来获利了结，而不是进一步买入。在某个时候，大多数交易者会把新高视为做空机会，而不仅仅是获利了结区域。

尽管许多交易者在第24根K线之后的看跌K线下方做空，但大多数交易者仍然相信趋势是向上的，并且回调之后会测试牛市高点。在出现强劲的看跌走势并有效跌破看涨趋势线之前，强势的空头通常不会主导市场。

---

>Since this was a trend day, a trader would ideally swing part, take profits along the way, and then go back to a full position size on every pullback. However, most traders cannot continue to hold part of their trade for a swing and also repeatedly scalp the other part. Traders instead should try to put on a full position early and not take additional signals, and instead scale out of their profits as the market works higher. There are many ways to do this. For example, if they bought early on and had to risk about $1.00 (probably less), they might have taken a quarter off after a $1.00 profit and another quarter off at $2.00, and maybe a third quarter at $3.00, and held onto the final quarter until either a strong sell signal formed or until the end of the day. It was better if they instead waited until the market rallied $2.00, or twice their initial risk, before taking their initial profit, because they had to sure that they were adequately compensated for taking that initial $1.00 risk. It does not matter how they did it, but it was important to have taken some profit along the way in case the market reversed down.However, since traders subjected themselves to risk, they must resist the temptation to exit with too small a reward. As long as the trend is good, it is always best to try to resist taking profits until the market has gone at least twice as far as your initial risk. If traders are out of half of their position but then see another strong buy signal, they might put part or all of the other half back on, at least for a scalp;but most traders should simply stick to their original plan and enjoy their growing profit.
---

##### 趋势日交易策略：波段持仓与分批获利

既然这是个趋势日，理想情况下，交易者会**波段持有**部分仓位，沿途**获利了结**，然后在每次回调时恢复满仓。然而，大多数交易者无法同时持续持有部分仓位进行波段交易，又反复对另一部分进行剥头皮操作。

相反，交易者应该尝试**早期建立满仓**，不再追逐额外信号，而是随着市场持续走高**分批了结利润**。实现这一点的方式有很多。例如，如果他们早早买入并承担了约1.00美元的风险（可能更少），他们可以在盈利1.00美元时平掉四分之一仓位，盈利2.00美元时再平掉四分之一，盈利3.00美元时可能再平掉三分之一的四分之一，然后持有最后一部分，直到出现强劲卖出信号或直到收盘。

---

##### 初始获利的考量与风险补偿

更好的做法是，他们等到市场上涨2.00美元，即其初始风险的两倍后，才进行首次获利了结，因为他们必须确保其初始1.00美元的风险得到了充分补偿。

无论如何操作，沿途获利了结很重要，以防市场反转下跌。然而，既然交易者承担了风险，他们就必须抵制以过小的回报退出的诱惑。只要趋势良好，**最好始终抵抗获利了结的冲动，直到市场至少达到您初始风险的两倍。**

如果交易者已经平掉了一半仓位，但又看到另一个强劲的买入信号，他们可能会重新入场部分或全部另一半仓位，至少是为了剥头皮；但大多数交易者应该简单地坚持其原始计划，享受不断增长的利润。

---

>With all of these buy signals, traders could have accumulated an uncomfortably large long position if they kept adding new longs, which they should not have done. Instead, they should have simply held their position until a possible end of the trend, like at bar 24, or they could have scalped out part after each new high as soon as a bar had a weak close, like at bars 16,21, or 24. Then they could have put the scalp portion back on when they saw another buy signal. They would have continued to hold their swing portion until the end of the trend.
---

##### 避免过度加仓与分批管理头寸

面对如此多的买入信号，如果交易者不断增加新的多头头寸，他们可能会积累到一个令人不舒服的巨大多头仓位，这是他们不应该做的。

相反，他们应该简单地持有他们的头寸，直到趋势可能结束，比如在第24根K线，或者他们可以在每次创新高后，一旦有K线收盘疲软时（例如在第16、21或24根K线），就**剥头皮**平掉一部分仓位。然后，当他们看到另一个买入信号时，他们可以重新建立剥头皮的这部分仓位。而他们的**波段仓位**则会一直持有到趋势结束。

---
>When did traders see this day as a trend day? Aggressive bulls thought that the gap up and strong bull trend bar had a reasonable chance of leading to a trend from the open bull trend day, and they might have bought on the close of bar 1 or one tick above its high. Their initial protective stops were one tick below the bar 1 low, and they planned on holding part or all of the position until the close or until a clear short signal formed.
---

##### 何时被视为趋势日：激进多头的视角

激进的多头交易者认为，**跳空高开**和强劲的看涨趋势K线很有可能预示着这是一个**开盘即趋势的牛市日**。他们可能在第1根K线收盘时或其高点上方一个跳动点买入。

他们的初始保护性止损设在第1根K线低点下方一个跳动点，并计划持有部分或全部仓位直到收盘，或者直到形成明确的做空信号。

---

>Other traders always look for double bottoms on gap up days, and they would have bought above the two-bar reversal that began at bar 3, which formed an approximate double bottom with bar 1 or with the low of doji bar that followed it.
---

##### 跳空高开日与双重底交易机会

其他交易者在**跳空高开**的日子里总是寻找**双重底**。他们本可以在第3根K线开始的两K线反转上方买入，该反转与第1根K线或其后的十字星K线低点形成了近似的双重底**交易机会**。

---

>Bar 4 was a strong bull trend bar that broke above the opening range and closed above the bar 2 high. Some traders bought at one tick above the bar 2 high, and others bought on the close of bar 4 or one tick above its high. This breakout bar was a statement by the bulls that they owned the market, and most traders at this point believed that the market was always-in long. For the time being, the best place for a protective stop was one tick below its low, but since that was almost a dollar lower, traders had to choose a small enough position size so that they were trading within their comfort zone.
---

##### 强势突破与入场策略

第4根K线是一根强劲的看涨趋势K线，它突破了开盘区间并收盘在第2根K线高点上方。一些交易者在第2根K线高点上方一个跳动点买入，另一些则在第4根K线收盘时或其高点上方一个跳动点买入。

这根**突破K线**是多头向市场宣示主权，此时大多数交易者都认为市场已处于“总是做多”的状态。

---

##### 止损设置与仓位管理

暂时来说，最好的保护性止损位置是其低点下方一个跳动点，但由于这几乎低了一个美元，交易者必须选择足够小的仓位大小，以便在自己的舒适区内进行交易。

---

>Most traders saw the day as a bull trend day by bars 5 or 7, and probably as soon as bar 4closed. Once traders believe the day is a trend day, if they are flat, they should buy a small position either at the market or on any small pullback. Traders could have placed limit orders to buy below the low of the prior bar and to buy at a certain number of cents down, like maybe 20, 30, or 50 cents. Others would have looked to buy above a high 2 on a stop or on a moving average pullback. Buying above the bar 8 two-bar reversal was a reasonable long, as was the wedge bull flag (some saw it as a triangle) that ended in a two-bar reversal at bar 12.The protective stop would still have been below the bar 4 low or maybe below its midpoint.Traders need to trade small enough so that their risk is within their normal risk tolerance.Other traders had their stops below the bars 6 and 8 double bottom, and if they got stopped out but the market then formed another buy signal and they believed that the bull trend was still intact, they would have bought again.
---

##### 确认趋势日与初始建仓

多数交易者在第5或第7根K线时，很可能在第4根K线收盘后，就已经认定这是一个**牛市趋势日**。一旦交易者相信当天是趋势日，如果他们空仓，就应该市价买入小仓位，或者在任何小幅回调时买入。

交易者可以设置限价订单，在前一根K线低点下方买入，或者在下跌一定点数（比如20、30或50美分）时买入。其他人则会寻求在高2位置止损买入，或者在移动平均线回调时买入。

---

##### 合理的入场机会与止损管理

在第8根K线**两K线反转**上方买入是一个合理的做多**交易机会**，在第12根K线以**两K线反转**结束的**楔形牛旗**（有些人认为是三角形）也是。保护性止损仍会设在第4根K线低点下方，或者可能在其中心点下方。

交易者需要交易足够小的仓位，以便他们的风险在正常风险承受范围内。其他交易者则会将止损设在第6和第8根K线**双重底**下方，如果他们被止损离场，但市场随后形成了另一个买入信号，并且他们仍然相信牛市趋势完好无损，他们会再次买入。

---

>The most important thing that traders must force themselves to do, and it is usually difficult,is as soon as they believe that the day is in a trend, they must take at least a small position.They must decide where a worst-case protective stop would be, which is usually relatively far away, and use that as their stop. Because the stop will be large, their initial position should be small if they are entering late. Once the market moves in their direction and they can tighten their stop, they can look to add to their position, but they should never exceed their normal risk level. When everyone wants a pullback, it usually will not come for a long time. This is because everyone believes that the market will soon be higher, but they do not necessarily believe that it will be lower anytime soon. Smart traders know this and therefore they start buying in pieces. Since they have to risk to the bottom of the spike, they buy small. If their risk is three times normal, they will buy only one-third of their usual size to keep their total dollar risk within their normal range. When the strong bulls keep buying in small pieces, this is buying pressure, and it works against the formation of a pullback. The strong bears see the trend, and they too believe that the market will soon be higher. Since they think it will be higher soon, they will stop looking to short. It does not make sense for them to short if they think that they can short at a better price after a few more bars. So the strong bears are not shorting and the strong bulls are buying in small pieces, in case there is no pullback for a long time. What is the result? The market keeps working higher. Since you need to be doing what the smart traders are doing, you need to buy at least a small amount at the market or on a one- or two-tick pullback or a 10 or 20 cent pullback, and risk to the bottom of the spike (the low of bar 4 for most traders, but some would have put their stops below the low of bar 3).Even if the pullback begins on the next tick, the odds are that it won't fall far before smart bulls see it as value and buy aggressively. Remember, everyone is waiting to buy a pullback,so when it finally comes it will only be small and not last long. All of those traders who have been waiting to buy will see this as the opportunity that they wanted. The result is that your position will once again be profitable very soon. Once the market goes high enough, you can look to take partial profits or you can look to buy more on a pullback, which will probably be at a price above your original entry. The important point is that as soon as you decide that buying a pullback is a great idea, you should do exactly what the strong bulls are doing, and buy at least a small position at the market.

### 趋势交易的核心：克服等待心理，果断入场

交易者必须强迫自己做一件事，尽管这通常很困难：**一旦您认定当天是趋势日，就必须至少建立一个小型头寸。** 您需要确定最坏情况下的保护性止损点，这通常相对较远，并将其作为止损。由于止损位会很大，如果您入场较晚，初始仓位就应该小一些。

一旦市场朝着您的方向移动并且您可以收紧止损，就可以考虑加仓，但绝不能超过您的正常风险水平。当所有人都期待回调时，它通常会迟迟不来。这是因为所有人都相信市场很快会走高，但他们不一定认为市场很快会走低。

### 聪明交易者的策略：小额分批买入

聪明的交易者深知这一点，因此他们开始**小额分批买入**。由于他们必须承担到急涨底部的风险，所以他们买入的仓位很小。如果他们的风险是正常情况下的三倍，他们将只买入平时仓位的三分之一，以将总美元风险控制在正常范围内。

当强势多头持续小额分批买入时，这会形成买盘压力，并阻碍回调的形成。强势空头看到趋势后，也相信市场很快会走高。既然他们认为市场很快会走高，他们就会停止寻找做空机会。如果他们认为几根K线之后能以更好的价格做空，那么现在做空就没有意义。所以，强势空头不做空，强势多头则小额分批买入，以防长期没有回调。

结果是什么？**市场持续走高。**

### 遵循市场领导者的步伐

既然您需要做聪明交易者正在做的事情，那么您就需要**市价买入至少一个小额仓位，或者在仅仅一两个跳动点或10到20美分的回调时买入，并承担到急涨底部的风险**（对大多数交易者而言是第4根K线的低点，但有些人会将止损设在第3根K线的低点下方）。

即使回调在下一个跳动点就开始，很可能它也不会跌太远，聪明的多头就会将其视为价值区域并积极买入。请记住，所有人都等着买入回调，所以当它最终到来时，只会是小幅且持续时间不短。所有那些一直在等待买入的交易者都会将这视为他们梦寐以求的**交易机会**。结果是，您的头寸很快就会再次盈利。一旦市场达到足够高的位置，您可以选择部分获利了结，或者在回调时买入更多，此时价格可能已经高于您的原始入场价。

重要的点是，**一旦您认定买入回调是一个好主意，您就应该立即做强势多头正在做的事情，并至少市价买入一个小型头寸。**

>After the market moved above the bar 7 high, many traders trailed their protective stops below the most recent swing low, which was at bar 8. As long as the market holds above the most recent swing low, the trend is likely still very strong. If it starts to make lower lows, the market could be transitioning into a trading range or even a bear trend. In either case, traders would then trade it differently from how they would trade a one-sided market (a trend).

### 趋势跟踪与止损管理

在市场突破第7根K线高点之后，许多交易者会将他们的**保护性止损**追踪至最近的摆动低点下方，即第8根K线的位置。

---

### 趋势判断与市场转换

只要市场保持在最近的摆动低点上方，趋势很可能仍然非常强劲。如果市场开始形成更低的低点，那么它可能正在向**交易区间**转换，甚至可能转变为**熊市趋势**。无论是哪种情况，交易者都将以不同于单边市场（即趋势市场）的方式进行交易。

>Bulls would continue to buy pullbacks all day long, and after the market went to another new swing high, they would move their protective stop to below the most recent swing low. For example, once the market moved above the bar 16 high, traders tightened their protective stops to below the bar 19 low. Many traders moved their stops to breakeven once there was a pullback that tested their entry price and then the market reached a new high. They did not want the market to come back down to their entry price a second time, and if it did, they would have believed that the trend was not strong.

### 牛市中的持续买入与止损调整

在牛市中，多头会**全天持续买入回调**，并且在市场创下新的摆动高点后，他们会将保护性止损移动到最近的摆动低点下方。

例如，一旦市场突破第16根K线的高点，交易者就会将他们的保护性止损收紧到第19根K线的低点下方。许多交易者在回调测试到他们的入场价格后，并且市场创下新高时，会将止损移动到**盈亏平衡点**。他们不希望市场在第一次测试后创新高之后第二次回到他们的入场价格，如果真的发生，他们会认为趋势不够强劲。

>Bar 24 was the third push up from the spike up to bar 15 (bar 21 was the second push up), so the market was likely to correct for a couple of legs sideways to down. The bar after it was a bear inside bar so the market might have reversed down at this point, especially since this would have been a failed breakout above the trend channel line. The market made a couple of attempts to pull back to the moving average earlier in the day, so it was reasonable to assume that it might succeed this time. This was a good place to take profits on the swing longs.Aggressive traders might have gone short for a scalp, but most traders would have waited to see if a 20 gap bar buy signal formed at the moving average.

##### 第24根K线：潜在回调与利润了结

第24根K线是从第15根K线急涨以来的第三次上涨（第21根K线是第二次上涨），因此市场很可能会**横盘或向下修正**几“腿”。其后的K线是一根看跌内包K线，因此市场可能在此时反转向下，特别是因为这本会是趋势通道线上方的一个失败突破。

当天早些时候，市场曾尝试几次回调到移动平均线，因此这次假设它可能会成功是合理的。这是一个**了结波段多头利润**的好地方。

##### 激进与保守交易者的策略选择

激进的交易者可能会做空进行剥头皮交易，但大多数交易者会等待，看移动平均线处是否形成一个**20缺口K线买入信号**。

>Should traders try to take most of these entries? Absolutely not. However, if they are watching on the sidelines, wondering how to get in, all of these setups are reasonable. If they take just one to three of these swing entries, they are doing all that they need to do and should not worry about all of the others.

---

##### 交易机会的选择：重质不重量

交易者应该尝试抓住所有这些入场**交易机会**吗？绝对不应该。

然而，如果他们在一旁观望，想知道如何入场，那么所有这些**交易机会**都是合理的。如果他们只抓住其中一到三个波段入场点，他们就已经做到了需要做的一切，不应再为所有其他机会而烦恼。
